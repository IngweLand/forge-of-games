👷 Attention City Builders! The Forge of Games City Planner just got even better! 🌟

All **Arabia cities** are now available in the city planner! You can create them from scratch or import them using the browser extension.

Some cities—such as those in the Maya, China, and Arabia cultures—have buildings that cannot be moved. In the game, you need to unlock these buildings in various ways. In the city planner, such buildings can also be locked or unlocked. To toggle their state, select the building and then click the **Lock/Unlock** button in the building’s properties.

Note that in some cities (e.g., Maya), you also need to unlock the map expansion beneath the building. You do this the same way you unlock other expansions—by clicking on the empty cell of the map expansion you want to unlock.

When creating a city from scratch, all non-movable buildings are locked by default. When importing an existing city, their lock state will be taken from the game. Please note: your existing city layouts in the planner currently have all lockable buildings unlocked, so you may want to adjust their state to get accurate city stats.
