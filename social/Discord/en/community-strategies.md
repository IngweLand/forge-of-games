We are pleased to share the interactive version of the guide, created through the collaboration between Dagorad and Forge of Games. Thank you for your time and valuable feedback in improving the City Planner and City Strategy Viewer/Builder.

You can access the strategy by navigating to the [Strategies Dashboard](https://forgeofgames.com/city-planner/strategies) and clicking on an item in the Community Strategies section.

If you find a bug in the viewer or builder, please report it on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/4vFeeh7CZn). Please keep this thread exclusively for guide discussions.
