We are pleased to share **Community Strategies** – interactive versions of the allied culture guides, created through the collaboration between Dagorad and Forge of Games.

The first one for **Arabia Petra** is available. You can access the strategy by navigating to the [Strategies Dashboard](https://forgeofgames.com/city-planner/strategies) and clicking on an item in the Community Strategies section.

If you find a bug in the viewer or builder, please report it on [Forge of Games Discord server](https://discord.gg/4vFeeh7CZn). 

To discuss strategies themselves, visit [this Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1199677867341140049/1466215219549179958).
