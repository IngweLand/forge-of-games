## ðŸŒŸ The City Planner update

### Inspirations:
- Added a Happiness Usage Ratio â€” a higher value means a more efficient use of happiness.
- The total city area is now displayed.
- When using the expansion template for searches, if no exact match is found, the system will now search for cities with the same total area.
- Search form values are now persisted between visits.
