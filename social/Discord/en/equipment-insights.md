## ðŸ“¢ Introducing the "Most Used Equipment" Section of the Hero Profile ðŸš€

We analyzed hundreds of thousands of heroes to bring you this detailed insight. The **Most Used Equipment** section is now available on every heroâ€™s page. It provides a summary of the most frequently equipped items for a selected hero, organized by hero level ranges.

This section highlights up to **three of the most common equipment sets**, along with the **top three main attributes** and **top three sub-attributes** used by players.

For example, in the attached image for the Ring slot:

- *The Lancerâ€™s Set* is most commonly used at hero levels 20â€“39.
- *Base Damage* is the most used main attribute at hero levels 40â€“59.
- *Attack Bonus %* is the second most common level 4 sub-attribute at hero levels 40â€“59.
