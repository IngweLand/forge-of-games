## Support Forge of Games ❤️

This holiday season is a great time to support **Forge of Games**.

👉  [Support us page](https://forgeofgames.com/support-us)

For nearly a year, I’ve personally covered all hosting and maintenance costs. Unfortunately, I can no longer fund the project alone.

Starting in **2026**, **server costs will rely entirely on community support**.

The current goal is simple: **secure the funding for the minimum server costs required to keep Forge of Games online**.

If you’re able to contribute, please consider donating now. Forge of Games is built for the community, and your support helps keep it available for everyone.

🎄 🎁 ❤️ Happy Holidays!
