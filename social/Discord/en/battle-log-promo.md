📢 **Hey everyone!**  
We figured folks in this thread might be interested in checking out the **[Battle Log](https://forgeofgames.com/battle-log?utm_source=discord&utm_medium=hoh_server&utm_campaign=battle_log&utm_content=battle_advice_en)** — a **community-driven database** of real battles in *Heroes of History*! 🛡️⚔️

Over **20,000 battles** have already been logged, but we need **your help** to grow it even further. The more players contribute, the better we can represent a wide range of **heroes** and cover larger number of **encounters**.

If you play *Heroes of History* in your browser — even just occasionally — consider installing our browser extension and becoming a contributor! 🙌
