* Switch between layouts instantly
* Compare performance metrics across different designs
* Perfect for optimization and experimentation

### 💡 Real Example
I just tested the Snapshots feature myself - with just a few minor layout adjustments, I managed to increase my city's food production by 37% in minutes! You can check out how I did it here: https://forgeofgames.com/cityPlanner/sharedCities/68976996dfd44a998e49274934e5213a
