📢 **Update Time!** 🚀

## ⚔️ Battle Log
- **New Feature: Battle Timeline.** Available on the **Battle Page** (accessible by clicking the **Info** icon 🛈 in the header of the concrete battle).
- See a full breakdown of all hero abilities used during battle, displayed with timestamps in seconds.
- If multiple actions occur at the same time, they are sorted in the order they happened in-game.
- The timeline also gives you a clear picture of how long the battle lasted.
- Each item in the timeline is clickable and opens the *Battle Squad Details* dialog for deeper insight.
- The timeline is available for battles from approximately the **last 2 weeks** and will also be shown for all **new battles** going forward.

## 📊 Stats Hub
- Data quality has been significantly improved! In most cases, the data you see on **Player** and **Alliance** profile pages is no more than 1 day old.
- The **Alliance page** now correctly shows the latest list of members and ranking points.
- You can now see when each player joined the alliance.
- The **Alliance page** layout has been refreshed. Icons have been added to highlight alliance leaders and officers.
- Player profile pages now have better visual separation between **current** and **previous alliances**.
- While we already have a large number of players and alliances in the system, some may still be missing. The best way to add them is by installing our browser extension and contributing data.

## 🦸 Heroes Database
- **Filters are here!** You can now filter heroes by **class, type, rarity**, and more.
- Selected filters are saved between sessions for your convenience.
- You can still search by name — just switch modes with the search button.

## 🏰 New Age
- **Early Gothic Era** has been introduced into all tools, giving you a sneak peek at what’s coming next.
