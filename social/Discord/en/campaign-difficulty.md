## 🎉 New Update for Campaign and Treasure Hunt 🎉

- 🔥 **Campaign Difficulty Options:** Customize your challenge level by choosing either *normal* or *hard* difficulty.
- 💥 **Encounter Wave Power Values:** Monitor enemy wave strength in both Campaign and Treasure Hunt.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Squad Management Options:** Encounter squads are aggregated by default for a compact UI, with the option to separate them. You can toggle this with two buttons (expand more, expand less).
- 💡 **Color Advantage Hints:** Hints based on the color advantage system are available for *green*, *blue*, and *red*. (Units of other colors deal equal damage.) A *thumb up* (👍) indicates that the hero with that color has an advantage over the adversary, while a *thumb down* (👎) indicates that the adversary has the advantage.
- 💰 **Crypto Donations:** Support Forge of Games with cryptocurrency donations.
- 🐛 **Bug fixes**
