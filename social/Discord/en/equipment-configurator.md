We’re thrilled to introduce a new addition to Forge of Games — the [Equipment Configurator](https://forgeofgames.com/command-center/equipment-configurator).

This tool lets you test unlimited equipment configurations, view resulting stats, and find the best setup. Currently in ***beta***.

Start by importing your equipment directly from the game or use [this shared equipment profile](https://forgeofgames.com/command-center/equipment-configurator/shares/7dcab29729394422a7659c68ce82bf7a) to try the configurator right away.

Note: due to the large amount of displayed data, the configurator works best on desktop computers and is not optimized for small mobile screens.

Feedback is welcome.

If you enjoy Forge of Games, please consider supporting it — we rely entirely on donations to cover server costs.
