## 🪖 Battle Log - Real Player Battles! 🪖

We're expanding the **[Stats Hub](https://forgeofgames.com/stats-hub)** with a brand-new tool: the **[Battle Log](https://forgeofgames.com/battle-log)**!  
Get insights from real player-submitted battles—see which hero setups succeed, and which don’t.

### 🔍 What You’ll Find:
- 🧠 Community-submitted battles with hero details and outcomes
- 📊 Battle stats
- 🎯 Filters to find specific encounter or hero matchups
- 🚀 Quick access from Campaign & Treasure Hunt pages with pre-filled filters

🧩 **Note:** Battle Log has just launched and is currently very limited—**we heavily rely on your contributions** to grow it. The more battles shared, the more useful it becomes!

### 🧪 Want to Help?
Just install/update the [HoH Helper browser extension](https://forgeofgames.com/help/browser-extension), enable data collection, and play normally. Your battle data will be added automatically!
