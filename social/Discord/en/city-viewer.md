### Great news for mobile users!

We’ve added **City Viewer** — a lightweight version of City Planner, optimized for smaller screens. You can use *pinch-to-zoom* and *pan* gestures to explore the layout, or tap *the analytics icon* to view city statistics.

For editing the layout, you’ll still need to use a larger screen. City Viewer will automatically open whenever you view the city layout on a small screen.
