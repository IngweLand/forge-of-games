📢 **Update Time!** 🚀

## City Planner

- Added "Is upgrading" checkbox and corresponding icon. Particularly useful when investigating allied culture cities and creating city strategies. It shows that the building is upgrading and does not add to the city stats.
- Added building and premium section counts to the Area section of the city stats.
- Fixed the sorting of the city stats so that coins and food (or corresponding resources in the allied culture cities) always appear at the top.

## City Viewer

- You can now select individual buildings and see their stats.

## Player profile

- Added **Wonder levels** section. It shows the final wonder level in a particular allied culture event. Currently available for members of the top alliances.
- Added **City properties** section with *Production capacity* and *Premium expansions* sub-sections. The latter shows the premium expansion count as well as the amount of gems spent on them.

## Heroes

- Added 5-star [Ashoka the Great](https://forgeofgames.com/heroes/AshokaTheGreatLegendary).
- Added a preview for new heroes: [Howard Carter](https://forgeofgames.com/heroes/HowardCarter) and [Imhotep](https://forgeofgames.com/heroes/Imhotep)
