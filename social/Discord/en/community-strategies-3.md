Maya: Sayil Palace interactive strategy

We are pleased to share **Community Strategies** – interactive versions of the allied culture guides, created through a collaboration between **Dagorad** and **Forge of Games**.

**Sayil Palace** and **Arabia Petra** are now available. You can access them by navigating to the [Strategies Dashboard](https://forgeofgames.com/city-planner/strategies) and clicking on an item in the Community section. We also host written guides directly on Forge of Games, available on the same page. Note that both guides and strategies are updated periodically.

If you find a bug in the viewer or builder, or have a suggestion on how to improve the tools, please report it on the [Forge of Games Discord server](https://discord.gg/4vFeeh7CZn).

To discuss strategies themselves, visit [this Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1199677867341140049/1468743735302160414).

What you can expect to see in the Strategy Viewer:
- A timeline of step-by-step progression through the event
- Tools you are already familiar with: city planner, building/wonder cost calculators, research calculator, and building/city stats
- Depending on your screen size, these tools are either in the sidebars, can be toggled from the top bar, or accessed by tapping on a building
- On larger screens, you can enter Strategy Builder mode — this creates a local copy of the strategy and allows you to edit it in place
- The Difference Mode is specifically designed for the Strategy Viewer — it highlights changes between the current and previous layouts, keeping modified buildings in color. You can still interact with all buildings as usual.
