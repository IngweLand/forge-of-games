We are **super excited** to release a **new feature** – *visiting other players' cities*!

### 🏙️ How to Access It
1. Go to any player’s page in the **Stats Hub**.
2. You’ll see two new buttons: **"Visit"** and **"View City Stats"**.
3. Click one of the options.
4. Once the city is fetched, you’ll be navigated to either the City Planner or the City Stats page.
5. By default, the city is **not saved** in the City Planner. To store it locally, click the **"Save"** button.

> 💡 **Note:** Cities are cached, so you might see a slightly outdated layout.

> 💡 **Note:** This feature is currently available only for players on the Beta server. Main server support will be added once the feature is publicly released in the game.

> ⚠️ If the **"Visit"** button becomes enabled again but you are **not redirected** to the City Planner, an error likely occurred. **Please report it.**
