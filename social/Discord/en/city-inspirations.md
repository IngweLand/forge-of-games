We are **super excited** to release a **new feature** – ✨ **Inspirations**!

You can find it on the newly re-designed **City Planner Dashboard**.

### 🏙️ How to Use It
1. Set your **city age**, then choose your preferred **resource** – 🥗 *food*, 💰 *coins*, or 🏭 *goods*.
2. Check the **"Allow premium buildings"** box if you want to include layouts that contain premium buildings.
3. (Optional) Select one of your **own saved city layouts** (from the City Planner) as a template for the opened expansion.
4. Click **Search**.
5. Click on any search result to open it directly in the **City Planner**.

### 🛠️ City Planner Improvements
1. **New Dashboard**: See all your cities and easily create a new one with the **Create New City** button.
2. **Inventory**: You can now place your buildings (all or individually) into an inventory to make redesigning easier. The inventory is saved along with your city layout when you click the **Save** button—so you can continue redesigning later!

> ⚠️ **Note**: We've temporarily removed the **Undo/Redo** functionality while we fix some pesky bugs.
