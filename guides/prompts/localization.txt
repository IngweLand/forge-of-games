Translate the following .resx tags into the following locales:
cs-CZ, de-DE, es-ES, fr-FR, it-IT, ja-JP, nl-NL, pl-PL, zh-TW.

Instructions:

1) Grammar check: Before translating, review the English values in the .resx file for any grammatical errors.

	- If you identify any issues, list them clearly and pause processing.
	- If mistakes are absent, proceed with translation without asking.
	- Do not perform any translations until further instructions are given in response.

2) Refer to translations.json as the primary source of truth. It contains all locales, including English. Each entry has a Key and a Strings object. The Key is internal and not related to the .resx keys. Strings contains a singular and optionally plural form.

3) For each value in the .resx file, perform an exact match against the English strings in translations.json. If a match is found, use the associated key to retrieve translations for the required locales.

4) If no exact match is found, attempt a partial match. Use the result as contextual guidance only. Do not copy the value directly—either adapt it or translate it based on context.

5) If no match (exact or partial) is found, translate the entry independently.

Output format:
Provide the translation for each locale inside a code block, labeled with the locale code as the language identifier (e.g., ````cs-CZ```). Do not include comments (neither in reply nor inside code blocks) or explanations—only the translation content. The output must be valid resx tags, which I can paste into current resx files.
