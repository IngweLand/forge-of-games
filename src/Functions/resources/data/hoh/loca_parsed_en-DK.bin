Base.Units.Unit_LadySixSky_Desc Stand above your defeated foes with Lady Six Sky! This 8th century Maya queen is famed for ruling over the city of Naranjo, and despite her name being unknown her legend has never been forgotten. But she was born in the city of Dos Pilas, and arrived at Naranjo only later in life.<br><br>From the day of her arrival, she was the de facto ruler. Lady Six Sky took the reigns of power and turned them to the heavens: she erected stelae and carried out religious rituals in the manner of the Kings.<br><br>Much of Lady Six Sky's history - that which has not been carved into stone - has been lost. As a living avatar of the moon goddess and maize god, Lady Six Sky represented both queen and king, sun and moon. Lady Six Sky's epic journey is a testament to the idea that a queen's influence can be as vast and enduring as the night sky itself!

 Base.Units.Unit_OdaNobunaga_DescÒBring fire and thunder to the battlefield with Oda Nobunaga! This legendary daimyo of 16th-century Japan was a brilliant, ruthless unifier whose ambition set the stage for the end of centuries of civil war. Born in 1534, Nobunaga quickly gained a reputation as ‚ÄúThe Fool of Owari‚Äù for his wild youth, but he soon showed his true cunning‚Äîand no one laughed for long.<br><br>Nobunaga introduced firearms into Japanese warfare in a big way, defeating his rivals with both strategy and superior firepower (and occasionally a bit of dramatic flair). He destroyed Buddhist warrior-monks at Mount Hiei, toppled powerful clans, and even dreamed of unifying the nation under his banner‚Äîa feat nearly achieved before his dramatic betrayal at Honno-ji in 1582.<br><br>Although his story ended in flames, Nobunaga's impact was anything but fleeting: he paved the way for the Tokugawa shogunate and the Japan we know today. Fearless, unconventional, and occasionally terrifying‚ÄîOda Nobunaga always played to win!

 Base.Regions.SiegeOfOrleans_DescÄIt is May 1429, the ninety-first year of the Hundred Years‚Äô War. English forces have been pushing into France, and six months ago they reached Orl√©ans, a walled city on the banks of the river Loire. For the English assault to continue, the city must fall. So for the last six months the enemy has been building fortifications while cannons roar by night. For six months food has been scarce. For six months hope has been gone.<br><br>Joan of Arc was supposed to save them. In our world, the warrior-saint, her banner and her head held high, entered Orl√©ans, and with her she brought food and safety and hope. But here, she never arrived. The city is on its last legs, and it falls to the Heroes of History to save the city without her. The people are ready, but the English are coming. One last battle must be fought, one battle to save Orl√©ans, one battle to let France reclaim her freedom.

With a simple turn, you can reveal which stars will greet you at sunset, and plot your celestial journey for the night ahead. The universe might be vast and mysterious, but in your hands, the planisphere makes it suddenly familiar.

Rising from humble beginnings, Saladin united the fractured Muslim world and reclaimed Jerusalem.<br><br>At the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Saladin's tactical brilliance shattered the Crusader army, leading to the recapture of Jerusalem after 88 years of Christian rule. Yet it was his mercy that truly made him legendary - he allowed the city's Christian inhabitants to leave peacefully, and when King Richard the Lionheart's horse was killed in battle, Saladin sent him two replacements.<br><br>Saladin's clever tactics defeated some of the greatest knights and kings Europe could muster, while his fame for mercy and wisdom rivaled his prowess in battle. He rebuilt fortresses, sponsored learning, and ensured the prosperity of his lands even amid war. To this day, Saladin is remembered across the world as a paragon of leadership and virtue; his campaigns changed history and his title, al-Malik an-Nasir (the Victorious King), speaks for itself.

This mythical hero has traveled for centuries, if not millennia, across the Arctic, facing spirits, shamans, and the very forces of nature itself. His odyssey began when he was set adrift as a young man, and since then, his kayak has carried him through adventures that would break lesser mortals.<br><br>Kiviuq's tales are as numerous as the stars in the northern sky. He has escaped from murderous spirits, married the daughter of the Moon, and outwitted cannibalistic giants. In one story, he transforms into various animals to escape danger; in another, he rescues his community from starvation by finding new hunting grounds across impossible distances. His journey is eternal - some say he still paddles the Arctic waters, searching for his way home.<br><br>To the Inuit peoples across the Arctic, from Alaska to Greenland, Kiviuq represents resilience, cleverness, and the indomitable human spirit. His stories have been told in igloos and qaggiq for countless generations, teaching survival, morality, and hope in the harshest environment on Earth.

He invented his own styles, and was nearly unmatched with the blade.<br><br>Musashi journeyed across Japan, on a Musha shugyo or Warrior's Quest. He fought in 62 duels and won them all, even winning one of them with a carved bit of oar. Before retiring, he fought in battles and duels alike, and taught many swordsmen.<br><br>His unique style and tactical genius set him apart, making him a revered figure in martial arts history. Beyond the battlefield, Musashi was also a philosopher and an artist, authoring 'The Book of Five Rings', a guide that continues to inspire with its wisdom on strategy and life.

Base.Units.Unit_Plato_DescıTaking a break from bickering on the Piraeus, it's Plato! This seminal Greek philosopher from the 4th century BC was a student to Socrates and a teacher to Aristotle. He founded the Academy in Athens and wrote 'The Republic', shaping Western thought forever.<br><br>Plato's teachings not only inspired thought but also fantasy: Plato introduced the story of Atlantis, a legendary sunken civilization, in his work 'Timaeus'.<br><br>His philosophical ideas, such as the Theory of Forms, have shaped the West so much that a famous philosopher once described the European tradition as 'a series of footnotes to Plato.' Lesser known is the fact that Plato could probably scrap with any warrior in the Heroes of History: he was so big even his name means 'broad'!

Base.Units.Unit_MarieCurie_DescﬂMarie Curie changed science forever. This pioneering Polish scientist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries revolutionized our understanding of the natural world. She discovered the elements polonium and radium and developed the field of radioactivity, a term she coined.<br><br>Curie's genius earned her two Nobel Prizes, in Physics and Chemistry, making her the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the only person to win in two different sciences. Her work paved the way for advancements in medicine and nuclear physics.<br><br>Though she benefited little from her discovery, refusing to patent it, radioactivity became its own industry. Curie continued to serve both science and her country until her death, but her legacy lives on in: elements, scientific measurements, and Parisian streets all bare her name. Truly, she set hearts and minds 'aglow'.

In the early 19th century, Shaka rose to power amid the rolling hills of southern Africa, transforming the Zulu people from a small clan into a formidable kingdom. With a keen mind for tactics, he revolutionized warfare with the introduction of the short stabbing spear and the fearsome 'bull's horn' formation - a combination that swept aside his foes and united the region under the Zulu banner.<br><br>Under his command, the Zulu nation expanded from 1,500 people to an empire commanding respect across hundreds of miles. Shaka's leadership inspired fierce loyalty; his vision brought order, innovation, and strength to his people. The Zulu army became the stuff of legends, known for discipline, unity, and their earth-shaking war dance.<br><br>Even off the battlefield, Shaka sparked new traditions, festivals, and pride that endure in South Africa to this day. He created a sense of Zulu identity that endures to this day, and his tactics were studied by military academies worldwide.

This advisor and architecture of the 27th century BCE oversaw the construction of the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, one of the earliest pyramids of all history.<br><br>In life, Imhotep was a mystery, a priest of Ra of whom little is known. In the years after, his fame grew, until he became deified: worshiped as a god of medicine and brother to the god Thoth.<br><br>This is how Imhotep was remembered for years. Even the Greeks supposedly worshiped him, and he was credited for ending floods in the Roman period. Ironically, it seems he was never even involved with medicine in life!

He escaped and led the Third Servile War, a major slave rebellion. Under his command, the rebels swelled in numbers, defeating Roman legions and causing unrest across the Republic. Spartacus aimed to secure freedom by leaving Roman territory, but internal disputes and strategic challenges hindered their plans.<br><br>In the end, Roman forces under Marcus Licinius Crassus defeated the rebellion.

Base.Relics.GuardianLion_Desc¢Across Asia, stone lions guard temples, palaces, and tombs. They come in prides of two: one female and one male, yin and yang. The female protects a cub, who represents the lives within, while the male guards a ball of material, which is a mirror of the edifice it adorns. Once constructed, they would ward the building forever, turning away any -- human or spirit -- that would do the inhabitants harm.<br><br>These lions have spread from China across the world, especially south and east. Many call them ‚Äútemple dogs‚Äù, seemingly after the Japanese name ‚ÄúKorean Dog‚Äù. Either way, their form and function is similar across most of Asia. From English markets to Filipino cathedrals, from Chinese palaces to New York Chinatown, you are never far from the watchful eyes of one of these protectors.

Base.Relics.TheHolyGrail_DescßThe knights of Camelot quest for the Holy Grail to prove their worth. First it was Percival who sought the Grail, a Celtic knight who sought chivalry. Next came Gawain, heroic and noble, Arthur‚Äôs closest companion. Galahad was next, son of Lancelot, a young man who could perform miracles and duel better than anyone. As time moves on, the hunt has grown stranger. The Knights Templar, the Cathars, a certain fedora-wearing archeologist, spacemen and rappers and video game characters, fiction is filled with hunters.<br><br>But nobody could have guessed that the person to find it would be you! Its magic grants rejuvenation, healing wounds and preventing aging. As a symbol of virtue, it also reminds the heroes of the rightness of their actions, just as it acted as a beacon for the knights of Camelot.

Born Erik Weisz in 19th-century Hungary and raised in America, Houdini transformed himself from a struggling sideshow performer into a global sensation, stunning audiences by slipping out of handcuffs, jail cells, straitjackets, and even sealed tanks of water with seemingly supernatural skill.<br><br>Houdini's feats were the talk of vaudeville and the toast of royalty, and his boundless showmanship made him a legend in the world of magic. But he wasn't just about spectacle - he dedicated himself to debunking fraudulent mediums, exposing those who preyed on grief with false spiritualism. His legacy as a master of illusion and advocate for honesty survives to this day, though no one has yet found the secret for escaping his level of flair, or his now legendary locked trunks!

They say that these stories are just legends from the time-shrouded shores of a mist-shrouded isle.<br><br>But the sword Excalibur is here. King Arthur‚Äôs blade, pulled from a stone through the birthright of kings, Excalibur is claimed to cut through steel as though it were wood, to gleam so bright it could blind enemies. With it at his side, Arthur has carved a path through his rivals into the myths of Britain. Yet, if it has truly returned, that must mean the Isle of Avalon is emerging, too, from the mists.

Base.Relics.Mjolnir_DescÓWhen thunder rolls across the sky, Norse myth says it is Thor hurling his hammer, Mjolnir. Forged by dwarves and empowered to shatter mountains, Mjolnir is far more than a weapon - it's the shield and protector of the gods, the divine force that keeps chaos in check.<br><br>The hammer's magic is unique: it always returns to its owner, no matter how far thrown, and only those worthy of Thor's might can lift it. Vikings wore miniature Mjolnirs as amulets for strength and protection, hoping some of Thor's power might rub off. If storm clouds gather and lightning crackles, who can say? Mjolnir might just be passing by.

Base.Regions.FallOfTroy_Desc°It is the last night of the Trojan War, in a time that was ancient even to the ancient Greeks. Ten years ago, the Trojan prince Paris carried off Helen, queen of Sparta, and the Greeks swore revenge and set sail to bring her home.<br><br>After a decade before its high walls, the Greek army is exhausted; and the city of Troy stands unbroken. Even the mighty Achilles has fallen. But clever Odysseus offers a new plan: a wooden horse is left as a gift, and the Greek fleet slips out of sight.<br><br>At dawn, the prize is drawn within the walls. Odysseus and his chosen fighters wait hidden inside, ready to slip out after nightfall and unbar the gate for the returning army. In our world, that was enough. Troy burned before dawn, and the war was over.<br><br>But not here. Warned by Tesla, the Trojans ring the horse with barricade walls and brace the gates tight.

#Base.Units.Unit_VincentVanGogh_DescÌPut your heart on canvas alongside Vincent van Gogh! This renowned Dutch painter of the late 19th century caught hearts and created wonders with his paintbrush, creating vibrant works with emotive brushwork.<br><br>Despite battling against his own mental health and a world hostile to him, Van Gogh produced over two thousand artworks in only a decade.His most iconic works, like 'Sunflowers' and 'Starry Night', show vivid insights into the beauty of the world, expressed through curling brushstrokes and dynamic composition.<br><br>Van Gogh was mostly appreciated after his death. His art was mostly considered worthless in life, but since then they have become among the most expensive works in all of human history. His legacy, even if he never got to imagine it, is of one of Earth's greatest artists. Perhaps Einstein can take him to the future after all of this is done!

Known formally as Kasuga no Tsubone, this remarkable noblewoman of early 17th-century Japan became one of the most influential figures in the shogunate's inner circle. Born in 1579, she joined the Tokugawa family as a lady-in-waiting and quickly earned the trust of Tokugawa Iemitsu, the third shogun of the dynasty.<br><br>Lady Kasuga served as the shogun's wet nurse, advisor, and political mastermind - the power behind the screens. She's especially famed for organizing the Ooku, the shogunal women's quarters, and for her diplomatic skills: negotiating with daimyo, securing alliances, and overseeing courtly etiquette with both iron discipline and a keen sense of humor.<br><br>Her subtle influence helped sustain Tokugawa rule with style, wit, and steely resolve. To the samurai outside, it may have seemed all quiet in the inner chambers, but Lady Kasuga's legacy reminds us - the real power often works in secret!

This renowned leader of the Hunkpapa Lakota Sioux in the 19th century is celebrated for resisting U.S. government policies and colonization efforts. Known for his wisdom and leadership, he was instrumental in uniting the Sioux tribes during a period of intense conflict and change.<br><br>He played a pivotal role in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where Sioux and Cheyenne forces achieved a significant victory against General Custer's troops. Sitting Bull became a symbol of Native American resistance and determination to preserve their way of life.<br><br>His legacy endures as an emblem of courage and cultural resilience in the face of adversity.

D'Artagnan (as we'll call him to save space) was a 17th century French Musketeers who's legend was expanded in Alexandre Dumas' 'The Three Musketeers'.<br><br>From relatively humble beginnings (only a minor noble), D'Artagnan served as a spy, a musketeer, and a governor, He was famed for his arrest of the ludicrously rich Nicolas Fouquet, whom he guarded personally: anyone else could be bribed.<br><br>D'Artagnan's life was grossly exaggerated in the novel 'Les m√©moires de M. d'Artagnan', which in turn was grossly exaggerated in the novel 'The Three Musketeers' by Alexandre Dumas. This version - a chivalric, swashbuckling, hero - lives on today. D'Artagnan was perhaps a little more boring. He keeps challenging Leonidas to a 'longest name' competition. Leonidas can't understand why he loses every time!

Originating from Persian legend and immortalized in 'One Thousand and One Nights', Scheherazade is a master of word-craft, captivating a cruel king with her endless imagination so that he, and her people, might live to see another dawn.<br><br>For 1,001 nights, she wove tales within tales - stories of djinn and sailors, clever servants and foolish kings, flying carpets and magic lamps. Characters like Aladdin, Ali Baba, and Sinbad all danced from her lips. By the end of her tales, the king had fallen in love with her wisdom and had been healed of his madness. Her stories didn't just save her own life - they ended the king's murderous practice forever.<br><br>Her cleverness, courage, and compassion have inspired generations of dreamers and writers. Though none can say for sure where fiction ends and reality begins, in the Heroes of History, Scheherazade's quick wit and endless reservoir of stories make her the most popular company at any campfire.

This 19th century German philosopher and economist changed economic thought forever by developing Marxism, which critiques capitalism and advocates for a classless society.<br><br>In 'The Communist Manifesto' and 'Das Kapital', Marx analyzed the socio-economic forces shaping society, arguing that 'the history of all society is {...} class conflict'. Believing that change would doubtless come, Marx sought to chart the exploitation of laborers across history.<br><br>Marx's words have sparked revolutions, inspired dictatorships, and encouraged welfare reforms. From university halls to stock markets and parliaments, Marxism and his teachings on the State are hotly debated even today. Either way, you have to admit say he left some big Marx on history!

Some, battered free by cosmic impacts on the moon, journey through the void for thousands of years before crash-landing on our world. Unlike your ordinary garden pebble, a Lunar Meteorite is a literal piece of the moon itself‚Äîtouched by no hands until it falls softly (or sometimes not so softly) to Earth.<br><br>Scientists prize these cosmic travelers, for they offer a way to study our lunar neighbor without the inconvenience and cost of building a rocket. To hold a lunar meteorite is to cradle ancient moonlight, to brush fingertips against the memory of deep space and cataclysmic collisions. If you listen closely, you might even hear‚Äîwell, nothing. Space is silent, after all.

Her intelligence, political acumen, and charisma, has secured her remembrance in history forever.<br><br>Cleopatra is most famous for her alliances with Roman leaders Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, strategic moves to protect Egypt's independence amid Roman expansion. Her relationship with Antony is particularly celebrated in art and literature.<br><br>Though often romanticized for her beauty, Cleopatra has been linked to dramatic stories involving her affinity for luxury and knowledge of poisons, symbolized by the asp. Her legacy endures as a symbol of political intrigue, cultural fusion, and the enduring allure of her captivating life. I'm not sure she can teach you to walk like an Egyptian, though: Cleopatra was ethnically Greek!

Base.Units.Unit_JohnLocke_DescøFrom the University of Oxford, it's the father of liberalism, John Locke! This 17th-century English philosopher shaped modern political thought. In 'Two Treatises of Government,' he proposed natural rights - life, liberty, and property.<br><br>Locke's social contract theory influenced modern democracy, emphasizing that governments must be based on the consent of the governed and hold accountability to the people. His ideas underscored the importance of individual rights and government responsibilities.<br><br>In epistemology, Locke's 'An Essay Concerning Human Understanding' argued that knowledge comes from experience. His philosophy greatly impacted Western thought, shaping concepts of individual rights and the role of government. Lesser known is his skill on the battlefield, but he'll prove to you that he's Locked in!

Base.Units.Unit_ElCid_Desc¬He fought for the Christians, he fought for the Muslims, and now he fights for you: El Cid has sworn to serve you. This knight and lord from the 11th Century is remembered as the ideal knight - brave, chivalrous, triumphant, and powerful ‚Äî but his legend began under the name Rodrigo D√≠az, a young soldier fighting for King Sancho II.<br><br>But these were tumultuous times for Castile. Sancho was slain, and his brother Alfonso ruled in his stead: a brother whom El Cid had fought against. Exiled, the knight joined the Muslims of Zaragoza, and led them time after time to victory. Here, he earned the name Al-saiyyid: the Master.<br><br>Years later, in Valencia, he became a lord, running the city independently. The city and its army was both Christian and Muslim, bringing El Cid's history to life in a pluralistic society. In Spain he is still known as 'the Champion', his greatest victories and final legend forged alongside his faithful horse, Babieca.

 Base.Units.Unit_QinShiHuang_DescŒAs mandated by heaven and written in a thousand monuments, it's Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China! In the 3rd century BCE, this former king claimed the throne of a unified China. Amid the smell of burning paper and the sharpening of blades, Qin Shi Huang conquered all of China, and began a legacy that would never be forgotten.<br><br>Under his rule, massive construction projects were undertaken, including the early Great Wall and the Terracotta Army, which guards his city-sized mausoleum. These efforts aimed to protect and solidify the empire's unity and strength.<br><br>Qin Shi Huang is a remembered as a tyrant: brutal, authoritarian, and all-powerful. Yet, this may be false: these words come from those who had the monumental task of replacing his dynasty. Either way, China has doubtless been shaped by the impact of this Son of Heaven. Unfortunately, as a Hero he's quite hard to work with. Him and Lincoln are currently refusing to speak to each other!

At thirty-three, he authored the Declaration of Independence, inspired by enlightenment ideals of liberty and individual rights.<br><br>Thomas Jefferson's fame reached its peak when he became president of the United States. He bargained with France for the territory of Louisiana, and upon its purchase he commissioned the Lewis and Clark expedition into that rugged land, allowing American expansion that would double the size of the United States.<br><br>Today, Jefferson is remembered as a bastion of liberal thought: an advocate for free thought, free speech, and rationalism.

Her defeat of the Spanish Armada solidified her status as a formidable leader, while her patronage of such people as Shakespeare meant her rule was never forgotten.<br><br>Known as the 'Virgin Queen' for never marrying, Elizabeth maintained her power and independence throughout her rule. Her legacy is one of strength, intelligence, and cultural patronage, leaving an indelible mark on English history. She also had a stripy mouth from eating too much sugar - her name is an anagram of 'Zebra Teeth is Filth'!

"Base.Relics.DrakkarFigurehead_DescπThe beach is white today. The fog lies thick across the waves, the pebbles stirred by the soft crashing of waves on the shore as birds keen overhead. The watchers scan the mist. Further north -- Lindisfarme, Iona, Jarrow --  the abbeys have fallen silent, raided by monsters from across the seas. It smells of sea salt and fear. Then the demons break through the fog. Dragons and monsters and serpents, all closing in on the shore. Another raid has begun.<br><br>Raids like this are well known in folklore. The Vikings of the 10th century AD sacked monasteries across Northumbria and Northern England, and their ships are recorded in the annals of history. Horrific serpentine beasts were carved into their fronts, and, even if they were intended to ward off evil spirits, they no doubt cemented the notoriety of the Vikings.

This 6th century emperor was renowned for his military prowess and strategic genius.<br><br>Cyrus united the tribes of Persia, then grew his territory across Asia Minor and Eastern Europe. The conquered satrapies were free to keep their own religions and customs, cementing Cyrus' legacy as a wise leader.<br><br>To the Jews he was a messiah, to the Babylonians a liberator, a hero to both Alexander the Great and Thomas Jefferson.

%Base.Relics.GoldenRaftOfElDorado_DescèThe Muisca people of the Andes wrought wonders from gold. Theirs was an egalitarian people, who shared their golden votives across all society. Every family decorated their windows and doors with gold, but a new King would cover himself in gold dust and set forth into a lake on a raft, letting the dawn‚Äôs light illuminate his body. Thus would a human ruler be born from the divine sun. This practice spawned the legends of El Dorado, the legendary city of Gold, which would captivate Europeans for generations.<br><br>The Muisca Raft itself is a model of the raft of the king, with depictions of the ruler and attendants upon it. It is one piece of gold, poured into a beeswax mold by a single artisan. It is a symbol of ancient Colombia, and the skill of the people of the Andes.

 Base.Units.Unit_AdaLovelace_Desc‹See the future written in numbers with Ada Lovelace! This 19th century English mathematician and writer is celebrated for her breakthroughs in the history of computing. She is best known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.<br><br>Lovelace recognized that the machine had potential beyond mere numerical calculations, and she wrote what is considered the first algorithm intended for implementation on a machine, making her the first computer programmer. She was the first to imagine the true possibilities of computers: if they could process not just numbers but symbols and sounds, they could be used to create virtually anything formulaic.<br><br>Despite the societal constraints of her time, Ada Lovelace's legacy as a trailblazer in computing continues to inspire future generations in science and technology. Programming languages are named after her, and she has her own day of the year! In 2019, a robot called Ai-Da was created. Ironically, Ada and Ai-Da would hate each other: Ada was staunchly against artificial intelligence in her writings.

She was the daughter of Thutmose I and rose to power as regent for her stepson, Thutmose III, eventually declaring herself pharaoh.<br><br>Her famous mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri is just one of countless monuments from her reign, but Hatshepsut also focused on trade expeditions, notably to the Land of Punt, enhancing Egypt's wealth and influence.<br><br>Often depicted in the clothes of male pharaohs, Hatshepsut's legacy as a strong and effective ruler endures. Her story is shaped by the struggle against traditional gender roles, highlighting her significance in Egyptian history.

Base.Units.Unit_MontezumaI_DescªBearer of the fire crown, champion of the Sea of the Sky, Great Speaker: there are no epithets beyond the reach of Montezuma, the second emperor of the Aztecs. This 14th-century emperor is remembered as an embodiment of the Aztec empire, in all its majesty and brutality. His coronation at Tenochtitlan was marked by vast sacrifice, a tradition his regime would only accelerate.<br><br>One of Montezuma's first acts was to ally with two nearby city-states. This Triple Alliance led to both conquest and prosperity, with aqueducts feeding Tenochtitlan and allowing the city to grow even as the empire swallowed up more of Mexico.<br><br>In truth, he was Moctezuma Xocoyotzin - his full name seldom used, for he is widely known simply as Montezuma. Even so, he was able to wield political power as more than a mere club. Montezuma's legacy is also one of faith: he is remembered as a hero-god, and in his time religious schools were set up across the Aztec domain. Within the Heroes of History, however, he's very annoyed that everyone keeps thinking he's his descendant, Montezuma II!

Base.Relics.FalconryGlove_Descô	In Japan, Takagari, or falconry, has been the practice of the wealthy for generations. Birds of prey accompanied samurai and emperors, for the sport was seen as a reflection of a warrior‚Äôs worth (and because only the rich could afford it) Daimyo rode forwards, birds on their fist, as a symbol of dominance over the spirit of the land, while artists painted sculptures and artworks of falcons. When the birds were ready, they would find their targets: rabbits and mice, doves and swans and cranes.<br><br>Yet every warrior who followed the path of Takagari, for all the talk of spirits and wealth, needed practical skills and equipment: discipline, patience, and a sturdy leather glove. Falcons‚Äô talons are sharp enough to pierce skin. This Falconry Glove is a Japanese specimen from the 16th century, the kind that may have been worn by Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu himself. It reminds the owner of the skill and mastery that people across the world have invested into their crafts, of the warrior‚Äôs spirit they themselves possess.<br><br>These Falconry Gloves bear the legacy of many magnificent falcons - just like the one depicted here, which was named Horus by the people.

This act of bravery has never been forgotten, making Leonidas a symbol of heroism in Greece and beyond.<br><br>He and his Spartans were slain to a man at Thermopylae, but Leonidas was saved, zapped back into the stone age with amnesia by one Albert Einstein.

%Base.Units.Unit_BenjaminFranklin_DescÓBenjamin Franklin is here to fork lightning with his words - and literally as well! This 18th century polymath not only was a founding father of the United Sates of America, who helped draft the Declaration of Independence and the constitution, but was also an author, inventor, and scientist.<br><br>Franklin was an early explorer into the field of electricity. He used a kite to gather 'electric fire' from a cloud, proving that lightning is electrical. Thus, he invented the lightning rod. He also invented bifocal glasses and studied the oceans .<br><br>But Franklin is perhaps most famed as a diplomat and writer. Franklin's skill with words secured French support in the American Revolution and were captured in books that are remembered today. For example, he might be able to make you rich: it was he who first claimed the two certain things in life are death and taxes!

Born in 1503, Michel de Nostredame became a physician renowned for his bravery during outbreaks of plague, but it was his mysterious prophecies that secured his lasting legacy. His book, Les Proph√©ties, delivered verses so cryptic that generations have puzzled over their true meaning, connecting them to events like devastating wars and the rise and fall of emperors.<br><br>Nostradamus' reputation reached the highest circles - he even read the fortunes of Catherine de' Medici, queen of France. Some say he gazed into a brass bowl, others into the stars, but his blend of astrology and poetic riddles continues to captivate both believers and doubters. Heroes whisper that he never leaves his scrying bowl unattended, and sometimes, late at night, his journal starts writing itself.

This 15th century Romanian duke is famed for his brutality, his cruelty, and, by some, for his bravery. During his rule, he dominated rivals and allies alike, leaving 'forests of corpses' in his wake.<br><br>Nearly five centuries later, Vlad Dracula's name inspired Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. Within this famed horror story, the Romanian Count Dracula travels to London, ready to engage in a lethal ballet with the solicitor Jonathan Harker and the professor Van Helsing.<br><br>Both inspired tales of horror. Vlad Dracula's cruelty made him the star of some of Germany's earliest bestsellers, while Count Dracula's legion of undead descendants terrifies readers to this day.

The Antikythera mechanism was an orrery, a device used to model the spinning of the sun and moon and planets through the sky. Ancient scientists would have used this to track the movement of the stars, to predict eclipses, to mark the passing of months and monthly festivals.<br><br>The Antikythera Mechanism is considered the world‚Äôs first analogue computer. It is a miracle of early science, unheard of again for another 15 centuries. It had 37 gears to move the model of the moon alone, all spun by hand by the scientists of the ancient world. Human ingenuity, it seems, is timeless.

!Base.Units.Unit_AdaBlackjack_Descõ	Survive the impossible with Ada Blackjack, the woman who conquered the Arctic alone! This Inupiat seamstress from the early 20th century became an unlikely hero when she outlasted veteran explorers on the desolate Wrangel Island. In 1921, she joined a Canadian expedition as a cook and seamstress, the only woman among four men.<br><br>When the expedition went catastrophically wrong, with supply ships failing to arrive and the men leaving to seek help but never returned, Ada was left utterly alone on the frozen island with only the expedition's cat, Victoria, for company. For two years, she survived where trained explorers had perished. Through extreme hardship, Ada taught herself to set traps, fire a rifle, fend for herself, using her resourcefulness to beat starvation and illness, even as the Arctic winter closed in. Despite being surrounded daily by hunger and polar bears, Ada's hope never faded.<br><br>Together, Ada and Vic braved blizzards and loneliness, their bond a source of comfort and warmth amid the cold. In time, Ada was rescued and returned home, and her story became an inspiration - proof that ordinary people are capable of extraordinary resilience.

This 20th-century aviator was the first ever Native American and first African American woman to hold a pilot's license, and has been an inspiration to those communities ever since.<br><br>When Coleman was growing up, American pilot schools disallowed both women and black people. Determined to fly, Coleman learned French and traveled to France to earn her international pilot's license, becoming the first black person to have one. She returned to America, performing daring feats in airshows, and then came back to Europe for more training.<br><br>Over the next ten years, Bessie Coleman became beloved, gaining the nickname 'Queen Bess'. She was a living inspiration to Black aviators, and a constant advocate for civil rights in her words and deeds. William J. Powell, another black aviator, claimed that thanks to her, 'we have overcome the barriers within ourselves and dared to dream'.

Born in a log cabin, his humble beginnings profoundly shaped his character and leadership style.<br><br>Lincoln's commitment to preserving the Union and his issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation were pivotal in reshaping the nation's values. Known for his eloquence, his Gettysburg Address remains one of the most famous speeches in American history.<br><br>Despite facing immense challenges, Lincoln's leadership and dedication to equality have left a lasting impact. His assassination marked a tragic end to his presidency, but not in this timeline: he escaped through a time portal and landed up in the Stone Age!

Base.Relics.Ouroboros_Desc∫Perhaps one figure has lasted longer in mysticism than any other. In the 14th century BC, over 3000 years ago, two snakes devouring their own tales were written in the Book of the Netherworld, found inside the tomb of Tutankhamun. In the Norse legends, the world serpent Jormungandr grew so large it would bite its own tail. From there, the figure passed into Christian Gnosticism, alchemy, psychology, chemistry, and magic.<br><br>The Ouroboros has grown to represent eternity. The snake is constantly both being consumed and consuming, life and death at once, a symbol that finds new relevance (and new appearances in pop culture) despite its ancient pedigree. Death and rebirth indeed! The Ouroboros reminds the heroes of how time ought to be, and their place within history. If they do not act, the snake will come undone.

This 16th century Korean admiral fought under the Joseon dynasty against the Japanese, never defeated in battle at sea. Trained from birth as a warrior, Yi led forces to countless victories until he was framed by a senior general.<br><br>Once reinstated, Yi was granted stations of higher and higher import. As a first-time admiral, he defeated the Japanese at Okpo without losing a single ship, and developed the turtle ship, the signature warship of the Joseon. <br><br>At the Battle of Myeongnyang, Yi rallied thirteen warships. Through the mists they struck, baiting the Japanese into changing tides and unsafe waters. Historical records describe the admiral's warship as a castle, standing amid the sea, securing Korean victory and Yi Sun-Sin's place in history.

This Shoshone explorer of the 17th and 18th centuries was the interpreter of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, a mission to explore the Louisiana Territory as commissioned by Thomas Jefferson. As such, she secured the western expansion and future of the United States.<br><br>Meeting with the two explorers at Fort Mandan, Sacagawea's guidance would prove essential.

This work is the foundation for Euclidian geometry, which would shape thought for the rest of history.<br><br>Euclid's life is a mystery, but his work is his legacy. Through a detailed, methodical, approach to reasoning and contributions that led to the development of the scientific method, Euclid truly changed the world.

This prominent Chan monk of the Song Dynasty was renowned for his spiritual insight and teachings.<br><br>As a key figure in reviving the Caodong school, he emphasized meditation and mindfulness, focusing on direct experience and personal enlightenment. His teachings amassed numerous disciples and significantly spread Chan Buddhism during that period.<br><br>Fuyu also changed martial arts forever. He invited all martial artists in China to the Shaolin temple, and they practiced together to develop one style. Forever after, the temple was called 'the birthplace of martial arts'.

(Base.Units.Unit_FlorenceNightingale_DescìDo not worry: The Lady with the Lamp is by your side. Florence Nightingale, a 19th-century British nurse, is famed for her work in the Crimean War, healing soldiers as they lay dying. <br><br> But Florence Nightingale's greatest achievements perhaps come later. After having assisted the military at Scutari and treated the sick of three armies, Nightingale led the reform of British nursing, promoting a modernised system that has shaped care to this day. Nurses swear the Nightingale Pledge, an echo of her own promise to help. <br><br> Florence Nightingale's legacy is thusly two-fold: on one hand, an angel, the Lady with the Lamp; on the other, a determined and brilliantly intelligent woman who changed hospitals forever. Perhaps neither is fully true. Nightingale's nickname was originally the Lady with the Hammer, after she broke into a locked medical supply ‚Äî perhaps this image is truer than any other!

According to the Norse sagas, this 9th century hero and warrior king led daring assaults on England and France, a blend of history and myth.<br><br>A master strategist and fierce commander, Ragnar married the warrior Lagertha, and with her fathered Bjorn Ironside and Ivar the Boneless, who themselves are attested in legend. Reafan, the raven banner, a symbol of the god Odin, guided him in every battle.<br><br>Much as tales of Ragnar inspired the Vikings with stories of valor and daring, they still excite audiences today, on TV, games, and books. However, the oldest historical sources talk about 'her' sons. Is it possible Ragnar is secretly a woman?

This monumental German composer of the late 18th and early 19th centuries remains the man who bridged the Classical and Romantic periods in Western music.<br><br>Known for his immense influence and innovative spirit, Beethoven crafted an array of masterpieces, including nine symphonies, piano concertos, and string quartets. He moved to Vienna and quickly became recognized for his exceptional talent. Despite losing his hearing and being unable to hear his own compositions, he continued to compose some of his most admired works, such as the Ninth Symphony.<br><br>Beethoven's enduring legacy is marked by his extraordinary ability to convey deep emotion and complexity through music. Perhaps the most well known two bars of all music are his creation.

Upon her ascension, she arranged for the care of the poor, the sick, and the old. This love for her populace would define her rule <br> <br> Queen Seondeok navigated conflict and peace with skill, faith, and grace. Silla was enriched by alliances, by great pagodas, and by observatories. Stories about her magnificence are recorded in the Samguk Yusa and other historical texts. <br><br>Seondeok's legacy is Korea itself. Her alliance with the Tang led to the first unification of Korea under Silla, and she sowed the seeds for the blossoming of the culture of the kingdoms. According to some of the stories, Seondeok was gifted with prophecy. Through bullfrogs and pictures of flowers, her legend grew. Let's see if you can do it: in the autumn, the crow will land on the bull's horns! What could that mean?

With her katana in her hands and as many as a thousand soldiers behind her, she fought in the Genpei War, under the command of Minamoto no Yoshinaka.<br><br>In the end, all but a few of Minamoto's soldiers abandoned him, even his own family. But never Tomoe Gozen. As they fled Kyoto by night, two rival generals attempted to stop their retreat. She slew one, and allowed the other to live with the shame of having been beaten.<br><br>Though the rest of her story is unknown, she will never be forgotten. Her loyalty and strength makes her an emblem to those fighting against expectations, and even today her story is retold in film and anime.

With a superior army, he led campaigns against the Grecian mainland, forging an alliance with key poleis on the peninsula.<br><br>By his death, Philip was a one eyed war hero, whose genius had seen him unite Greece into the League of Corinth, and was preparing to invade Persia when he was assassinated. Even that couldn't hold him back: he was deified and worshiped as a God, while his son Alexander continue his legacy.

Joan of Arc, the 15th century 'Maid of Orl√©ans', whose faith and devotion lead armies and changed history, is ready for battle. Known for her transformation from peasant girl to military leader, Joan believed she heard the voice of God guiding her.<br><br>With unfailing belief and an iconic banner, she motivated the troops of France, leading them to significant victories, especially at Orl√©ans. Her passion and resolve made her a symbol of faith, of war, and of France.<br><br>Joan is remembered as a shining example of bravery, for through her we remember that anyone, regardless of their birth, can inspire thousands. Though the English put her to death, instead of starting a fire, they accidentally opened up a time portal, dropping Joan of Arc into the past, where Einstein found her!

Base.Relics.BookOfTheDead_DescÿIf life in ancient Egypt was an arduous journey, the afterlife was even more perilous. Enter the Book of the Dead - a guidebook for souls, packed full with spells, passwords, and secret knowledge. Elegantly painted onto papyrus scrolls or the walls of tombs, these collections gave direction to the newly departed, helping them bypass demons, dodge cosmic crocodiles, and present themselves as ‚Äútrue of voice‚Äù before Osiris.<br><br>Think of it as the ultimate travel manual - except the destination is the Field of Reeds, and the stakes are eternal. With a Book of the Dead by your side, you don't just pass through the gates of the afterlife; you do so with confidence (and a little help from the world's earliest editors).

Ruling in the 16th century in what is now northern Nigeria, Amina was famed for her martial prowess, strategic mind, and fierce independence. As a young princess, she mastered the arts of horsemanship and warfare, quickly rising to lead armies and expand the reach of Zazzau's influence.<br><br>Queen Amina's reign saw the fortification of cities with defensive walls - many bearing her name even to this day - and the opening of trade routes that enriched her kingdom. Under her rule, Zazzau controlled the trade routes connecting the Sahara with the forests of the south.<br><br>She became a symbol of power, earning respect and awe across West Africa while leading battles from the front in full armor. For 34 years, she led her armies personally into battle, refusing to rule from a throne when she could command from horseback. Her story inspires generations as proof that courage knows no bounds - on the battlefield, in the council hall, or wherever her indomitable spirit rides.

This staff, entwined with a single serpent, was the symbol of Asclepius, god of healing and medicine. Temples to Asclepius served as some of history‚Äôs first hospitals, where the sick would dream in sacred halls and hope for a divine cure.<br><br>Unlike its cousin, the caduceus (which features two snakes and wings and often gets mistaken in medical logos), the Rod of Asclepius champions the singular power of healing, not hurried commerce. Even now, it inspires healthcare worldwide - a reminder that, sometimes, tending to the spirit is just as important as treating the body.

"Base.Regions.SpartasLastStand_Desc—It is August 480 BC, the Second Persian invasion of Greece is underway. King Xerxes of Persia leads a massive army, intent on conquering all of Greece. The narrow pass at Thermopylae, the 'Hot Gates', becomes the chosen battleground. Here, King Leonidas of Sparta stands with 300 of his finest warriors, ready to defend their land to the last breath.<br><br>For days, they withstand wave after wave of Persian attacks, their phalanx holding firm against the overwhelming numbers. Leonidas fights not just for Sparta, but for all of Greece, knowing that their stand buys crucial time for the Greek city-states to unite against the invader. <br><br>In our world, their valiant sacrifice became a symbol of courage and resistance. They were never meant to die on that day. Now, their fate is in your hands. The Heroes of History are summoned to tip the scales of destiny. With your arrival, Leonidas and his 300 are not merely holding the line. They are poised to rewrite history.

He centralized power on the crown, exemplified in the opulent palace of Versailles, which became the heart of his court.<br><br>Louis XIV expanded France's influence through military campaigns and territorial gains. He was also a patron of the arts, creating and funding works of spectacle. Soon, France became known as a dominant power, cultural and otherwise.<br><br>Louis is remembered as a complicated figure: a ballet dancer, a warmonger, a father, an artist, the center of the universe. His vanity was well-known: his house in your civilization has thirty five mirrors!

"Base.Units.Unit_HarunAlRashid_Desc∑	The moonlit courts of Baghdad shimmer once more, for Harun al-Rashid has arrived! This 8th-century Abbasid ruler presided over the Islamic Golden Age, when Baghdad was the jewel of the world and knowledge flowed like the Tigris and Euphrates. Harun's reign is a tapestry of luxury, wisdom, and intrigue - his palace rivaled any in the world, and his generosity to the poor and learned became the stuff of legend.<br><br>Harun al-Rashid established the legendary House of Wisdom, where scholars translated Greek texts and made groundbreaking discoveries in mathematics, medicine, and astronomy. The stories say he would disguise himself as a commoner and walk Baghdad's streets at night, listening to his people's concerns and dispensing justice. His diplomatic gifts to Charlemagne, including an elephant named Abul-Abbas, became the stuff of legend. Later on he was immortalized in the tales of 'One Thousand and One Nights'.<br><br>His legacy is not one of mere extravagance: Harun's Baghdad was the beating heart of a culturally dynamic, cosmopolitan empire. Within the Heroes of History, Harun can always be found swapping riddles with Scheherazade and settling disputes with a wave of his jeweled hand.

Base.Units.Unit_Blackbeard_DescŸThe seas are wild tonight, and the sailors are afraid. They've heard tales of the one they call Blackbeard, with fire in his hair and 40 cannons at the ready. This 18th-century pirate, whose real name was Edward Teach, cultivated a dread image, striking terror with black flags and red flame.<br><br>The name Blackbeard was earned when Teach stole La Concord, a French ship, and renamed it the Queen Anne's Revenge. From its armored hull he led daring raids, expanding his fleet with captured ships and new allies. His image, a pirate warlord with a long black beard and lit fuses around his head was so dreaded he obtained his nickname.<br><br>Blackbeard's legend perhaps overshadows the man. In the years since, Blackbeard has become a symbol, embodying both the romance and the terror of primacy. His ghost is said to haunt the Seven Seas, and his name still commands awe. Yet Blackbeard himself preferred to stay away from violence where possible, using fear to get what he wanted.

This 7th-century Maya King ruled for 68 years, but precides over his citystate of Palenque even beyond his death, for he was made one of the city's gods. Born amid crisis, Pakal took charge of Palenque at only 12, after the deaths of the previous monarch and his heir.<br><br>As king, Pakal The Great took care to appease, to expand, and to build. Since he was not of royal descent, he carved the achievements of rival claimants in every monument in the city, including the Palace of Palenque.<br><br>It is perhaps fitting that someone who wrote history in stone was himself immortalized in it: the Temple of the Inscriptions, purpose built to be Pakal's tomb-complex, contained vast tablets celebrating the history of the Maya people, and at its center, the beautifully decorate sarcophagus itself.

Base.Relics.SkyDiscOfNebra_Desc⁄When Stonehenge was still young and the pyramids glowed with fresh limestone, a group of Bronze Age astronomers in Central Europe cast their gaze skyward‚Äîand then to copper and gold. The Sky Disc of Nebra, unearthed in modern-day Germany, is a disc of bronze inlaid with gold symbols showing the sun, moon, and stars (including a prominent cluster of the Pleiades).<br><br>Dating to about 1600 BCE, the Sky Disc is thought by many to be the world‚Äôs oldest known depiction of the cosmos. Was it an astronomical tool‚Äîa Bronze Age star chart? Was it a ritual object, hung aloft when the solstice moon rose? No one can say for sure, but its creators clearly saw a universe worth mapping in gold. The Sky Disc bridges the gap between earthly life and celestial wonder, a mirror that reflects not just the stars above, but the curiosity that connects us all.

!Base.Units.Unit_LouisPasteur_DescıConquer diseases with Louis Pasteur, the father of Microbiology! This 19th century French scientist is famed for his discovery of the rabies vaccine, invention of pasteurization, and his theory of germs. <br><br> Pasteur is most known for injecting 9-year old Joseph Meister, who had been attacked by a rabid dog, with an inoculation for rabies. Months later, the boy remained healthy. Over the next year or so, Pasteur treated 350 others for the disease: only one contracted it. Yet, that is just a fraction of Pasteur's genius. He taught the heating of milk or wine to kill bacteria and the washing of hands before surgery, and set up the Pasteur Institute. <br><br> Today, he is followed by both fame and controversy. Many places in the world are named after this genius, but his notebooks reveal a sneaky side, deceiving and manipulating the truth in order to seem truly original.

This ancient Chinese military strategist is famed for writing 'The Art of War' in the 5th century BC, which shaped East Asian warfare for millennia. <br><br>'The Art of War' emphasizes strategy, deception, and adaptability, claiming 'the supreme art of warfare is to subdue the enemy without fighting.' Its principles have been applied in everything from war to business and sports, proving its timeless relevance. <br><br>Sun Tzu remains a symbol of guile and tactics, his teachings an influence on thinkers and leaders around the world. When he met the Heroes of History, Leonidas thought he must use animals in battle: why else would they call it a zoo?

'Base.Units.Unit_MargaretIOfDenmark_DescßThey called her Semiramis of the North, the Lady King, or The First Great Queen, but above all, she was Queen Margaret I of Denmark. This ruler of the 14th and 15 centuries first became Queen of Norway, then later ruled over Denmark and Sweden, uniting Scandinavia through the Kalmar Union.<br><br>A famed diplomat, Margaret kept control of the union despite facing disloyal nobles and the church. Governing on behalf of her grandnephew, she consolidated power and enforced a stability that hadn't been seen for a generation.<br><br>Her reign, in the end, brought a peace and prosperity to Scandinavia that had been sorely missed. Margaret I is remembered as a great queen, the 'greatest before or since'. Even so, not all remember her so fondly: to her rival King Albert she was known as 'King Breechless!'

Base.Units.Unit_IsabellaI_Desc°Answer destiny's call with Isabella I, the indomitable Queen of Castile! Ascending the throne in the late 15th century, Isabella proved herself a master of politics and tenacity, determined to unify Spain against all odds. She joined forces with Ferdinand of Aragon, forging a partnership that would unite much of the Iberian Peninsula and end centuries of internal division.<br><br>Isabella's reign saw the completion of the Reconquista with the fall of Granada, establishing Spain as a dominant power in Europe. She is famed for sponsoring Christopher Columbus's 1492 voyage, opening the doors to the New World - ushering in both the riches and controversies of the Spanish colonial empire. Yet her rule also brought the infamous Spanish Inquisition and deepened Catholic religious unity - sometimes with a heavy hand.<br><br>Proud, pious, and fiercely intelligent, Isabella's impact is undeniable. Whether you see her as a saint, a strategist, or something in between, her legend endures- though she's still puzzled why nobody remembers her chess skills!

This king from the 4th Century BC is famed for conquering vast swathes of the world before his early death.<br><br>Alexander took the throne at the age of 20, following his father's assassination. He quickly proved himself decisive: he conquered the Thracians and destroyed the famed city state of Thebes. This brought peace to Greece once more, and Alexander led the League of Corinth to conquer Achaemenid Persia. This famed empire fell before him, but Alexander wasn't done: before his armies knelt Syria, Babylon, Iran, and even Pakistan.<br><br>Alexander never lost a battle. In the end, his own army demanded a return to their homes. In Babylon, on the way home (although he did do some conquering on the way back), Alexander breathed his last.<br><br>Within the Heroes of History, Alexander is a bit controversial. He really enjoys drinking with Achilles, getting lessons off Cyrus, and showing up his dad!
