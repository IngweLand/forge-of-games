This 8th century Maya queen is famed for ruling over the city of Naranjo, and despite her name being unknown her legend has never been forgotten. But she was born in the city of Dos Pilas, and arrived at Naranjo only later in life.<br><br>From the day of her arrival, she was the de facto ruler. Lady Six Sky took the reigns of power and turned them to the heavens: she erected stelae and carried out religious rituals in the manner of the Kings.<br><br>Much of Lady Six Sky's history - that which has not been carved into stone - has been lost. As a living avatar of the moon goddess and maize god, Lady Six Sky represented both queen and king, sun and moon. Lady Six Sky‚Äôs epic journey is a testament to the idea that a queen‚Äôs influence can be as vast and enduring as the night sky itself!

 Base.Units.Unit_OdaNobunaga_DescÛBring fire and thunder to the battlefield with Oda Nobunaga! This legendary daimyo of 16th-century Japan was a brilliant, ruthless unifier whose ambition set the stage for the end of centuries of civil war. Born in 1534, Nobunaga quickly gained a reputation as ‚ÄúThe Fool of Owari‚Äù for his wild youth, but he soon showed his true cunning - and no one laughed for long.<br><br>Nobunaga introduced firearms into Japanese warfare in a big way, defeating his rivals with both strategy and superior firepower (and occasionally a bit of dramatic flair). He destroyed Buddhist warrior-monks at Mount Hiei, toppled powerful clans, and even dreamed of unifying the nation under his banner - a feat nearly achieved before his dramatic betrayal at Honno-ji in 1582.<br><br>Although his story ended in flames, Nobunaga‚Äôs impact was anything but fleeting: he paved the way for the Tokugawa shogunate and the Japan we know today. Fearless, unconventional, and occasionally terrifying - Oda Nobunaga always played to win!

 Base.Regions.SiegeOfOrleans_DescÄIt is May 1429, the ninety-first year of the Hundred Years‚Äô War. English forces have been pushing into France, and six months ago they reached Orl√©ans, a walled city on the banks of the river Loire. For the English assault to continue, the city must fall. So for the last six months the enemy has been building fortifications while cannons roar by night. For six months food has been scarce. For six months hope has been gone.<br><br>Joan of Arc was supposed to save them. In our world, the warrior-saint, her banner and her head held high, entered Orl√©ans, and with her she brought food and safety and hope. But here, she never arrived. The city is on its last legs, and it falls to the Heroes of History to save the city without her. The people are ready, but the English are coming. One last battle must be fought, one battle to save Orl√©ans, one battle to let France reclaim her freedom.

Her work paved the way for advancements in medicine and nuclear physics.<br><br>Though she benefited little from her discovery, refusing to patent it, radioactivity became its own industry. Curie continued to serve both science and her country until her death, but her legacy lives on in: elements, scientific measurements, and Parisian streets all bare her name.

But he wasn‚Äôt just about spectacle - he dedicated himself to debunking fraudulent mediums, exposing those who preyed on grief with false spiritualism. His legacy as a master of illusion and advocate for honesty survives to this day, though no one has yet found the secret for escaping his level of flair, or his now legendary locked trunks!

This first century statesman, writer, general, and leader, known for his military genius and bold political maneuvers, expanded Rome‚Äôs territories through notable conquests such as Gaul and Britain.<br><br>Under the eyes of Caesar, The Roman Army captured much of Europe and North Africa. At the same time, he rose throughout the political world of the Roman Republic, and instigated change that would bring about its end.<br><br>Caesar's shadow is cast over most of history: among his 'fans' are Napoleon Bonaparte and William Shakespeare. The words 'Tzar' and 'Kaiser' both come from his name. Since he arrived with the Heroes of History, Lincoln has been giving him lessons in dodging friends with knives!

This comprehensive approach highlighted the interconnectedness of different fields.<br><br>His teachings left a lasting legacy, influencing future generations and shaping Western thought. Pythagoras's work remains a cornerstone of mathematical and philosophical study, continuing to inspire inquiry and exploration today.

"Base.Units.Unit_JaguarWarrior_Desc˚The Aztecs believed the strength of the God Tezcatlipoca was embodied in the jaguar, and the jaguar warriors wore their skins to gain their power.<br><br>Jaguar warriors were treated as nobles within Aztec society, having proven themselves on the battlefield by taking captives. With their obsidian-bladed clubs, they fought almost constantly, for battle was the lifeblood of the Aztec empire.<br><br>Jaguar warriors perhaps exemplify Aztec warfare to this day. Combining training, culture, religion, and battle, they were believed to appease the very gods with their skill. For men dressed in animal onesies, that's pretty impressive!

#Base.Units.Unit_VincentVanGogh_DescÌPut your heart on canvas alongside Vincent van Gogh! This renowned Dutch painter of the late 19th century caught hearts and created wonders with his paintbrush, creating vibrant works with emotive brushwork.<br><br>Despite battling against his own mental health and a world hostile to him, Van Gogh produced over two thousand artworks in only a decade.His most iconic works, like 'Sunflowers' and 'Starry Night', show vivid insights into the beauty of the world, expressed through curling brushstrokes and dynamic composition.<br><br>Van Gogh was mostly appreciated after his death. His art was mostly considered worthless in life, but since then they have become among the most expensive works in all of human history. His legacy, even if he never got to imagine it, is of one of Earth's greatest artists. Perhaps Einstein can take him to the future after all of this is done!

Base.Units.Unit_KarlMarx_DescôCast off your chains with Karl Marx! This 19th century German philosopher and economist changed economic thought forever by developing Marxism, which critiques capitalism and advocates for a classless society.<br><br>In 'The Communist Manifesto' and 'Das Kapital', Marx analyzed the socio-economic forces shaping society, arguing that 'the history of all society is {...} class conflict'. Believing that change would doubtless come, Marx sought to chart the exploitation of laborers across history.<br><br>Marx's words have sparked revolutions, inspired dictatorships, and encouraged welfare reforms. From university halls to stock markets and parliaments, Marxism and his teachings on the State are hotly debated even today. Either way, you have to admit say he left some big Marx on history!

Sancho was slain, and his brother Alfonso ruled in his stead: a brother whom El Cid had fought against. Exiled, the knight joined the Muslims of Zaragoza, and led them time after time to victory. Here, he earned the name Al-saiyyid: the Master.<br><br>Years later, in Valencia, he became a lord, running the city independently. The city and its army was both Christian and Muslim, bringing El Cid's history to life in a pluralistic society.

"Base.Units.Unit_OracleOfDephi_DescΩBathe in the Castalian Spring, drink the holy waters of the Cassotis, and ready a goat, for the Oracle of Delphi is ready to prophecize! From the 8th century BC, people traveled to the Temple of Apollo, to hear whispers of the future.<br><br>These prophecies, delivered by the Pythia, a high priestess who embodied the Oracle, played a critical role in decision-making on matters of war, politics, and colonization. Leaders and common folk turned to the Pythia for advice again and again for over 8 centuries.<br><br>The Oracle of Delphi became a central figure in Greek culture, at the intersection of religion, politics, and society. More than 500 statements of the Oracle have been recorded: more than half are known to have come true. When I asked her if you're going to beat Tesla, she said that you'll need to keep playing!

 Base.Units.Unit_QinShiHuang_DescŒAs mandated by heaven and written in a thousand monuments, it's Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China! In the 3rd century BCE, this former king claimed the throne of a unified China. Amid the smell of burning paper and the sharpening of blades, Qin Shi Huang conquered all of China, and began a legacy that would never be forgotten.<br><br>Under his rule, massive construction projects were undertaken, including the early Great Wall and the Terracotta Army, which guards his city-sized mausoleum. These efforts aimed to protect and solidify the empire's unity and strength.<br><br>Qin Shi Huang is a remembered as a tyrant: brutal, authoritarian, and all-powerful. Yet, this may be false: these words come from those who had the monumental task of replacing his dynasty. Either way, China has doubtless been shaped by the impact of this Son of Heaven. Unfortunately, as a Hero he's quite hard to work with. Him and Lincoln are currently refusing to speak to each other!

Her defeat of the Spanish Armada solidified her status as a formidable leader, while her patronage of such people as Shakespeare meant her rule was never forgotten.<br><br>Known as the 'Virgin Queen' for never marrying, Elizabeth maintained her power and independence throughout her rule. Her legacy is one of strength, intelligence, and cultural patronage, leaving an indelible mark on English history.

This 6th century emperor was renowned for his military prowess and strategic genius.<br><br>Cyrus united the tribes of Persia, then grew his territory across Asia Minor and Eastern Europe. The conquered satrapies were free to keep their own religions and customs, cementing Cyrus' legacy as a wise leader.<br><br>To the Jews he was a messiah, to the Babylonians a liberator, a hero to both Alexander the Great and Thomas Jefferson. His fame is manifest in Iran, and his kindness in the Cyrus Cylinder, a declaration of statecraft and dreams. Cyrus was not only a talented statesman, he was also very cunning on the battlefield.

This 19th century English mathematician and writer is celebrated for her breakthroughs in the history of computing. She is best known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.<br><br>Lovelace recognized that the machine had potential beyond mere numerical calculations, and she wrote what is considered the first algorithm intended for implementation on a machine, making her the first computer programmer. She was the first to imagine the true possibilities of computers: if they could process not just numbers but symbols and sounds, they could be used to create virtually anything formulaic.<br><br>Despite the societal constraints of her time, Ada Lovelace's legacy as a trailblazer in computing continues to inspire future generations in science and technology. Programming languages are named after her, and she has her own day of the year! In 2019, a robot called Ai-Da was created. Ironically, Ada and Ai-Da would hate each other: Ada was staunchly against artificial intelligence in her writings.

She was the daughter of Thutmose I and rose to power as regent for her stepson, Thutmose III, eventually declaring herself pharaoh.<br><br>Her famous mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri is just one of countless monuments from her reign, but Hatshepsut also focused on trade expeditions, notably to the Land of Punt, enhancing Egypt's wealth and influence.<br><br>Often depicted in the clothes of male pharaohs, Hatshepsut's legacy as a strong and effective ruler endures. Her story is shaped by the struggle against traditional gender roles, highlighting her significance in Egyptian history.

This 14th century emperor is remembered as an embodiment of the Aztec empire, in all its majesty and brutality. His coronation at Tenochtitlan was marked by vast sacrifice, a tradition his regime would only accelerate.<br><br>One of Montezuma's first acts was to ally with two nearby city states. This Triple Alliance led to both conquest and prosperity, with aqueducts feeding Tenochtitlan and allowing the city to grow even as the empire swallowed up more of Mexico.<br><br>Even so, he was able to wield political power as more than a mere club. Montezuma's legacy is also one of faith: he is remembered as a hero-god, and in his time religious schools were set up across the Aztec domain. Within the Heroes of History, however, he's very annoyed everyone keeps thinking he's his descendant, Montezuma II!

%Base.Units.Unit_BenjaminFranklin_DescÓBenjamin Franklin is here to fork lightning with his words - and literally as well! This 18th century polymath not only was a founding father of the United Sates of America, who helped draft the Declaration of Independence and the constitution, but was also an author, inventor, and scientist.<br><br>Franklin was an early explorer into the field of electricity. He used a kite to gather 'electric fire' from a cloud, proving that lightning is electrical. Thus, he invented the lightning rod. He also invented bifocal glasses and studied the oceans .<br><br>But Franklin is perhaps most famed as a diplomat and writer. Franklin's skill with words secured French support in the American Revolution and were captured in books that are remembered today. For example, he might be able to make you rich: it was he who first claimed the two certain things in life are death and taxes!

Born in 1503, Michel de Nostredame became a physician renowned for his bravery during outbreaks of plague, but it was his mysterious prophecies that secured his lasting legacy. His book, Les Proph√©ties, delivered verses so cryptic that generations have puzzled over their true meaning, connecting them to events like devastating wars and the rise and fall of emperors.<br><br>Nostradamus‚Äô reputation reached the highest circles - he even read the fortunes of Catherine de‚Äô Medici, queen of France. Some say he gazed into a brass bowl, others into the stars, but his blend of astrology and poetic riddles continues to captivate both believers and doubters. Heroes whisper that he never leaves his scrying bowl unattended, and sometimes, late at night, his journal starts writing itself.

This 15th century Romanian duke is famed for his brutality, his cruelty, and, by some, for his bravery. During his rule, he dominated rivals and allies alike, leaving 'forests of corpses' in his wake.<br><br>Nearly five centuries later, Vlad Dracula's name inspired Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. Within this famed horror story, the Romanian Count Dracula travels to London, ready to engage in a lethal ballet with the solicitor Jonathan Harker and the professor Van Helsing.<br><br>Both inspired tales of horror. Vlad Dracula's cruelty made him the star of some of Germany's earliest bestsellers, while Count Dracula's legion of undead descendants terrifies readers to this day.

This 16th century Korean admiral fought under the Joseon dynasty against the Japanese, never defeated in battle at sea. Trained from birth as a warrior, Yi led forces to countless victories until he was framed by a senior general.<br><br>Once reinstated, Yi was granted stations of higher and higher import. As a first-time admiral, he defeated the Japanese at Okpo without losing a single ship, and developed the turtle ship, the signature warship of the Joseon. <br><br>At the Battle of Myeongnyang, Yi rallied thirteen warships. Through the mists they struck, baiting the Japanese into changing tides and unsafe waters. Historical records describe the admiral's warship as a castle, standing amid the sea, securing Korean victory and Yi Sun-Sin's place in history.

(Base.Units.Unit_FlorenceNightingale_DescìDo not worry: The Lady with the Lamp is by your side. Florence Nightingale, a 19th-century British nurse, is famed for her work in the Crimean War, healing soldiers as they lay dying. <br><br> But Florence Nightingale's greatest achievements perhaps come later. After having assisted the military at Scutari and treated the sick of three armies, Nightingale led the reform of British nursing, promoting a modernised system that has shaped care to this day. Nurses swear the Nightingale Pledge, an echo of her own promise to help. <br><br> Florence Nightingale's legacy is thusly two-fold: on one hand, an angel, the Lady with the Lamp; on the other, a determined and brilliantly intelligent woman who changed hospitals forever. Perhaps neither is fully true. Nightingale's nickname was originally the Lady with the Hammer, after she broke into a locked medical supply ‚Äî perhaps this image is truer than any other!

With her katana in her hands and as many as a thousand soldiers behind her, she fought in the Genpei War, under the command of Minamoto no Yoshinaka.<br><br>In the end, all but a few of Minamoto's soldiers abandoned him, even his own family. But never Tomoe Gozen. As they fled Kyoto by night, two rival generals attempted to stop their retreat. She slew one, and allowed the other to live with the shame of having been beaten.<br><br>Though the rest of her story is unknown, she will never be forgotten. Her loyalty and strength makes her an emblem to those fighting against expectations, and even today her story is retold in film and anime.

This 18th-century pirate, whose real name was Edward Teach, cultivated a dread image, striking terror with black flags and red flame.<br><br>The name Blackbeard was earned when Teach stole La Concord, a French ship, and renamed it the Queen Anne's Revenge. From its armored hull he led daring raids, expanding his fleet with captured ships and new allies. His image, a pirate warlord with a long black beard and lit fuses around his head was so dreaded he obtained his nickname.<br><br>Blackbeard's legend perhaps overshadows the man. In the years since, Blackbeard has become a symbol, embodying both the romance and the terror of primacy. His ghost is said to haunt the Seven Seas, and his name still commands awe. Yet Blackbeard himself preferred to stay away from violence where possible, using fear to get what he wanted.

$Base.Units.Unit_NubianMercenary_Desc·The Kandakes of Nubia were a series of queens of the Kingdom of Kush, who defied empires and built monuments. The first Kandake ruled in 200 BC; the last 400 BC, and many are famed for their leadership in the castle and the battlefield.<br><br>Many of the Kandakes have a different crowning achievement. Ameniras invaded Roman Egypt, forcing them to leave Kush alone, Aminatore built pyramids in Meroe, and Shanakdakhete constructed temples.<br><br>Together, the Kandakes embody an ancient egalitarianism that might surprise us in today's world. Which one is your Kandake? I'm not sure. Why don't you ask her?

This 7th-century Maya King ruled for 68 years, but presides over his citystate of Palenque even beyond his death, for he was made one of the city's gods. Born amid crisis, Pakal took charge of Palenque at only 12, after the deaths of the previous monarch and his heir.<br><br>As king, Pakal The Great took care to appease, to expand and to build. Since he was not of royal descent, he carved the achievements of rival claimants in every monument in the city, including the Palace of Palenque.<br><br>It is perhaps fitting that someone who wrote history in stone was himself immortalized in it: the Temple of the Inscriptions, purpose built to be Pakal's tomb-complex, contained vast tablets celebrating the history of the Maya people, and at its center, the beautifully decorate sarcophagus itself.

His presidency focused on Reconstruction and civil rights for freed slaves, women, and others, while attempting to secure a peace for America in the future.<br><br>Grant is remembered for his military genius and efforts toward national reconciliation and civil rights.

!Base.Units.Unit_LouisPasteur_DescıConquer diseases with Louis Pasteur, the father of Microbiology! This 19th century French scientist is famed for his discovery of the rabies vaccine, invention of pasteurization, and his theory of germs. <br><br> Pasteur is most known for injecting 9-year old Joseph Meister, who had been attacked by a rabid dog, with an inoculation for rabies. Months later, the boy remained healthy. Over the next year or so, Pasteur treated 350 others for the disease: only one contracted it. Yet, that is just a fraction of Pasteur's genius. He taught the heating of milk or wine to kill bacteria and the washing of hands before surgery, and set up the Pasteur Institute. <br><br> Today, he is followed by both fame and controversy. Many places in the world are named after this genius, but his notebooks reveal a sneaky side, deceiving and manipulating the truth in order to seem truly original.

'Base.Units.Unit_MargaretIOfDenmark_DescßThey called her Semiramis of the North, the Lady King, or The First Great Queen, but above all, she was Queen Margaret I of Denmark. This ruler of the 14th and 15 centuries first became Queen of Norway, then later ruled over Denmark and Sweden, uniting Scandinavia through the Kalmar Union.<br><br>A famed diplomat, Margaret kept control of the union despite facing disloyal nobles and the church. Governing on behalf of her grandnephew, she consolidated power and enforced a stability that hadn't been seen for a generation.<br><br>Her reign, in the end, brought a peace and prosperity to Scandinavia that had been sorely missed. Margaret I is remembered as a great queen, the 'greatest before or since'. Even so, not all remember her so fondly: to her rival King Albert she was known as 'King Breechless!'

Ascending the throne in the late 15th century, Isabella proved herself a master of politics and tenacity, determined to unify Spain against all odds. She joined forces with Ferdinand of Aragon, forging a partnership that would unite much of the Iberian Peninsula and end centuries of internal division.<br><br>Isabella‚Äôs reign saw the completion of the Reconquista with the fall of Granada, establishing Spain as a dominant power in Europe. She is famed for sponsoring Christopher Columbus‚Äôs 1492 voyage, opening the doors to the New World - ushering in both the riches and controversies of the Spanish colonial empire. Yet her rule also brought the infamous Spanish Inquisition and deepened Catholic religious unity, sometimes with a heavy hand.<br><br>Proud, pious, and fiercely intelligent, Isabella‚Äôs impact is undeniable. Whether you see her as a saint, a strategist, or something in between, her legend endures, although she‚Äôs still puzzled why nobody remembers her chess skills!

This king from the 4th Century BC is famed for conquering vast swathes of the world before his early death.<br><br>Alexander took the throne at the age of 20, following his father's assassination. He quickly proved himself decisive: he conquered the Thracians and destroyed the famed city state of Thebes. This brought peace to Greece once more, and Alexander led the League of Corinth to conquer Achaemenid Persia. This famed empire fell before him, but Alexander wasn't done: before his armies knelt Syria, Babylon, Iran, and even Pakistan.<br><br>Alexander never lost a battle. In the end, his own army demanded a return to their homes. In Babylon, on the way home (although he did do some conquering on the way back), Alexander breathed his last.<br><br>Within the Heroes of History, Alexander is a bit controversial. He really enjoys drinking with Achilles, getting lessons off Cyrus, and showing up his dad!
