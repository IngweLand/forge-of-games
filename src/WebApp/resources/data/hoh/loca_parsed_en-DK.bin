Base.Units.Unit_MarieCurie_DescﬂMarie Curie changed science forever. This pioneering Polish scientist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries revolutionized our understanding of the natural world. She discovered the elements polonium and radium and developed the field of radioactivity, a term she coined.<br><br>Curie's genius earned her two Nobel Prizes, in Physics and Chemistry, making her the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the only person to win in two different sciences. Her work paved the way for advancements in medicine and nuclear physics.<br><br>Though she benefited little from her discovery, refusing to patent it, radioactivity became its own industry. Curie continued to serve both science and her country until her death, but her legacy lives on in: elements, scientific measurements, and Parisian streets all bare her name. Truly, she set hearts and minds 'aglow'.

This advisor and architecture of the 27th century BCE oversaw the construction of the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, one of the earliest pyramids of all history.<br><br>In life, Imhotep was a mystery, a priest of Ra of whom little is known. In the years after, his fame grew, until he became deified: worshiped as a god of medicine and brother to the god Thoth.<br><br>This is how Imhotep was remembered for years. Even the Greeks supposedly worshiped him, and he was credited for ending floods in the Roman period. Ironically, it seems he was never even involved with medicine in life!

This Thracian gladiator became a symbol of resistance in the first century BC, leading a revolt against the Roman Republic.<br><br>Spartacus was a slave, forced into gladiatorial combat. He escaped and led the Third Servile War, a major slave rebellion. Under his command, the rebels swelled in numbers, defeating Roman legions and causing unrest across the Republic. Spartacus aimed to secure freedom by leaving Roman territory, but internal disputes and strategic challenges hindered their plans.<br><br>In the end, Roman forces under Marcus Licinius Crassus defeated the rebellion. Despite his death, Spartacus remains an enduring symbol of defiance and the fight for freedom. His favorite hobbies with the Heroes are arm-wrestling and shouting contests with Leonidas!

Though his life is shrouded in myth and mystery, he is best known for the Pythagorean theorem, establishing principles fundamental to geometry, thus being responsible for the headaches of millions of schoolchildren worldwide.<br><br>In Croton, he founded a school where his followers, the Pythagoreans, explored mathematics as well as music theory, astronomy, and ethics, believing numbers were central to understanding the universe. This comprehensive approach highlighted the interconnectedness of different fields.<br><br>His teachings left a lasting legacy, influencing future generations and shaping Western thought. Pythagoras's work remains a cornerstone of mathematical and philosophical study, continuing to inspire inquiry and exploration today. Lesser known is his sheer confidence: Legends say that when a venomous snake bit him, he bit it back and killed it!

"Base.Units.Unit_JaguarWarrior_Desc˚The Aztecs believed the strength of the God Tezcatlipoca was embodied in the jaguar, and the jaguar warriors wore their skins to gain their power.<br><br>Jaguar warriors were treated as nobles within Aztec society, having proven themselves on the battlefield by taking captives. With their obsidian-bladed clubs, they fought almost constantly, for battle was the lifeblood of the Aztec empire.<br><br>Jaguar warriors perhaps exemplify Aztec warfare to this day. Combining training, culture, religion, and battle, they were believed to appease the very gods with their skill. For men dressed in animal onesies, that's pretty impressive!

#Base.Units.Unit_VincentVanGogh_DescÌPut your heart on canvas alongside Vincent van Gogh! This renowned Dutch painter of the late 19th century caught hearts and created wonders with his paintbrush, creating vibrant works with emotive brushwork.<br><br>Despite battling against his own mental health and a world hostile to him, Van Gogh produced over two thousand artworks in only a decade.His most iconic works, like 'Sunflowers' and 'Starry Night', show vivid insights into the beauty of the world, expressed through curling brushstrokes and dynamic composition.<br><br>Van Gogh was mostly appreciated after his death. His art was mostly considered worthless in life, but since then they have become among the most expensive works in all of human history. His legacy, even if he never got to imagine it, is of one of Earth's greatest artists. Perhaps Einstein can take him to the future after all of this is done!

D'Artagnan (as we'll call him to save space) was a 17th century French Musketeers who's legend was expanded in Alexandre Dumas' 'The Three Musketeers'.<br><br>From relatively humble beginnings (only a minor noble), D'Artagnan served as a spy, a musketeer, and a governor, He was famed for his arrest of the ludicrously rich Nicolas Fouquet, whom he guarded personally: anyone else could be bribed.<br><br>D'Artagnan's life was grossly exaggerated in the novel 'Les m√©moires de M. d'Artagnan', which in turn was grossly exaggerated in the novel 'The Three Musketeers' by Alexandre Dumas. This version - a chivalric, swashbuckling, hero - lives on today. D'Artagnan was perhaps a little more boring. He keeps challenging Leonidas to a 'longest name' competition.

In the 3rd century BCE, this former king claimed the throne of a unified China. Amid the smell of burning paper and the sharpening of blades, Qin Shi Huang conquered all of China, and began a legacy that would never be forgotten.<br><br>Under his rule, massive construction projects were undertaken, including the early Great Wall and the Terracotta Army, which guards his city-sized mausoleum. These efforts aimed to protect and solidify the empire's unity and strength.<br><br>Qin Shi Huang is a remembered as a tyrant: brutal, authoritarian, and all-powerful. Yet, this may be false: these words come from those who had the monumental task of replacing his dynasty. Either way, China has doubtless been shaped by the impact of this Son of Heaven. Unfortunately, as a Hero he's quite hard to work with. Him and Lincoln are currently refusing to speak to each other!

This 16th century monarch ruled England for over fourty years, in an era of stability and prosperity for the country. It was a time of arts, of war, and of exploration.<br><br>Elizabeth managed challenges at home and abroad, overcoming religious zealotry (though not without burning a few people), and external wars. Her defeat of the Spanish Armada solidified her status as a formidable leader, while her patronage of such people as Shakespeare meant her rule was never forgotten.<br><br>Known as the 'Virgin Queen' for never marrying, Elizabeth maintained her power and independence throughout her rule. Her legacy is one of strength, intelligence, and cultural patronage, leaving an indelible mark on English history. She also had a stripy mouth from eating too much sugar - her name is an anagram of 'Zebra Teeth is Filth'!

This 6th century emperor was renowned for his military prowess and strategic genius.<br><br>Cyrus united the tribes of Persia, then grew his territory across Asia Minor and Eastern Europe. The conquered satrapies were free to keep their own religions and customs, cementing Cyrus' legacy as a wise leader.<br><br>To the Jews he was a messiah, to the Babylonians a liberator, a hero to both Alexander the Great and Thomas Jefferson. His fame is manifest in Iran, and his kindness in the Cyrus Cylinder, a declaration of statecraft and dreams. Cyrus was not only a talented statesman, he was also very cunning on the battlefield.

This 19th century English mathematician and writer is celebrated for her breakthroughs in the history of computing. She is best known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.<br><br>Lovelace recognized that the machine had potential beyond mere numerical calculations, and she wrote what is considered the first algorithm intended for implementation on a machine, making her the first computer programmer. She was the first to imagine the true possibilities of computers: if they could process not just numbers but symbols and sounds, they could be used to create virtually anything formulaic.<br><br>Despite the societal constraints of her time, Ada Lovelace's legacy as a trailblazer in computing continues to inspire future generations in science and technology. Programming languages are named after her, and she has her own day of the year! In 2019, a robot called Ai-Da was created. Ironically, Ada and Ai-Da would hate each other: Ada was staunchly against artificial intelligence in her writings.

This 18th century polymath not only was a founding father of the United Sates of America, who helped draft the Declaration of Independence and the constitution, but was also an author, inventor, and scientist.<br><br>Franklin was an early explorer into the field of electricity. He used a kite to gather 'electric fire' from a cloud, proving that lightning is electrical. Thus, he invented the lightning rod. He also invented bifocal glasses and studied the oceans .<br><br>But Franklin is perhaps most famed as a diplomat and writer. Franklin's skill with words secured French support in the American Revolution and were captured in books that are remembered today. For example, he might be able to make you rich: it was he who first claimed the two certain things in life are death and taxes!

'Base.Units.Unit_GreekMathematician_DescŸChart the rules that govern shapes with Euclid, the Father of Geometry! This Greek mathematician of the 3rd century BCE wrote mathematical treatises including 'Elements', a compilation of geometric knowledge that shaped Western Mathematics for centuries.<br><br>Within the 13 books of 'Elements', Euclid detailed much of geometry and math, including proofs for the Pythagorean Theorem and an analysis of prime numbers. This work is the foundation for Euclidian geometry, which would shape thought for the rest of history.<br><br>Euclid's life is a mystery, but his work is his legacy. Through a detailed, methodical, approach to reasoning and contributions that led to the development of the scientific method, Euclid truly changed the world. Indeed, it's said that the most studied book in the West is the Bible, but the second most is Euclid's 'Elements'!

Florence Nightingale, a 19th-century British nurse, is famed for her work in the Crimean War, healing soldiers as they lay dying. <br><br> But Florence Nightingale's greatest achievements perhaps come later. After having assisted the military at Scutari and treated the sick of three armies, Nightingale led the reform of British nursing, promoting a modernised system that has shaped care to this day. Nurses swear the Nightingale Pledge, an echo of her own promise to help. <br><br> Florence Nightingale's legacy is thusly two-fold: on one hand, an angel, the Lady with the Lamp; on the other, a determined and brilliantly intelligent woman who changed hospitals forever. Perhaps neither is fully true. Nightingale's nickname was originally the Lady with the Hammer, after she broke into a locked medical supply ‚Äî perhaps this image is truer than any other!

Battle-trained and invulnerable, thus he arrived at the Siege of Troy.<br><br>After the death of his lover Patroclus, Achilles sought out the opposing leader Hector in a blind rage. Though Hector was a mighty warrior and hero in his own right, he was no match for the might of Achilles.<br><br>Though he fell, his ankles pierced by arrows, at the gates of Troy, his actions in the siege proved instrumental, and his legend has inspired countless warriors, including Alexander the Great. Truly, nobody else shows how important it is to clean yourself all over!

Base.Units.Unit_Blackbeard_DescŸThe seas are wild tonight, and the sailors are afraid. They've heard tales of the one they call Blackbeard, with fire in his hair and 40 cannons at the ready. This 18th-century pirate, whose real name was Edward Teach, cultivated a dread image, striking terror with black flags and red flame.<br><br>The name Blackbeard was earned when Teach stole La Concord, a French ship, and renamed it the Queen Anne's Revenge. From its armored hull he led daring raids, expanding his fleet with captured ships and new allies. His image, a pirate warlord with a long black beard and lit fuses around his head was so dreaded he obtained his nickname.<br><br>Blackbeard's legend perhaps overshadows the man. In the years since, Blackbeard has become a symbol, embodying both the romance and the terror of primacy. His ghost is said to haunt the Seven Seas, and his name still commands awe. Yet Blackbeard himself preferred to stay away from violence where possible, using fear to get what he wanted.

Ameniras invaded Roman Egypt, forcing them to leave Kush alone, Aminatore built pyramids in Meroe, and Shanakdakhete constructed temples.<br><br>Together, the Kandakes embody an ancient egalitarianism that might surprise us in today's world. Which one is your Kandake? I'm not sure. Why don't you ask her?

!Base.Units.Unit_LouisPasteur_DescıConquer diseases with Louis Pasteur, the father of Microbiology! This 19th century French scientist is famed for his discovery of the rabies vaccine, invention of pasteurization, and his theory of germs. <br><br> Pasteur is most known for injecting 9-year old Joseph Meister, who had been attacked by a rabid dog, with an inoculation for rabies. Months later, the boy remained healthy. Over the next year or so, Pasteur treated 350 others for the disease: only one contracted it. Yet, that is just a fraction of Pasteur's genius. He taught the heating of milk or wine to kill bacteria and the washing of hands before surgery, and set up the Pasteur Institute. <br><br> Today, he is followed by both fame and controversy. Many places in the world are named after this genius, but his notebooks reveal a sneaky side, deceiving and manipulating the truth in order to seem truly original.

'Base.Units.Unit_MargaretIOfDenmark_DescßThey called her Semiramis of the North, the Lady King, or The First Great Queen, but above all, she was Queen Margaret I of Denmark. This ruler of the 14th and 15 centuries first became Queen of Norway, then later ruled over Denmark and Sweden, uniting Scandinavia through the Kalmar Union.<br><br>A famed diplomat, Margaret kept control of the union despite facing disloyal nobles and the church. Governing on behalf of her grandnephew, she consolidated power and enforced a stability that hadn't been seen for a generation.<br><br>Her reign, in the end, brought a peace and prosperity to Scandinavia that had been sorely missed. Margaret I is remembered as a great queen, the 'greatest before or since'. Even so, not all remember her so fondly: to her rival King Albert she was known as 'King Breechless!'

This king from the 4th Century BC is famed for conquering vast swathes of the world before his early death.<br><br>Alexander took the throne at the age of 20, following his father's assassination. He quickly proved himself decisive: he conquered the Thracians and destroyed the famed city state of Thebes. This brought peace to Greece once more, and Alexander led the League of Corinth to conquer Achaemenid Persia. This famed empire fell before him, but Alexander wasn't done: before his armies knelt Syria, Babylon, Iran, and even Pakistan.<br><br>Alexander never lost a battle. In the end, his own army demanded a return to their homes. In Babylon, on the way home (although he did do some conquering on the way back), Alexander breathed his last.<br><br>Within the Heroes of History, Alexander is a bit controversial. He really enjoys drinking with Achilles, getting lessons off Cyrus, and showing up his dad!
