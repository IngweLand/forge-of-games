    <h3>Player Profile Help Guide</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The Player Profile page provides a detailed overview of an individual player's progress, performance, and
        history. It combines general stats, interactive elements, historical data, and visual insights to help you
        analyze any player across multiple dimensions.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>General Information</h5>
        <p>
            The top section of the profile shows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Player avatar and name</li>
            <li>Current alliance (if any) — clickable and links to the
                <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_ALLIANCE_PROFILE_PATH">Alliance Profile page</a></li>
            <li>World</li>
            <li>Current ranking position and ranking points</li>

        <h5>Action Buttons</h5>
        <p>
            Below the general information, there are two main action buttons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visit</strong> — Opens the player's Capital city in the <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_CITY_PLANNER_PATH">City Planner</a>. This
                feature is only available on larger screens. Note that city layouts are cached and might be slightly
                outdated. If the button re-enables but does not redirect, an error likely occurred or the city could not
                be fetched.
            </li>
            <li><strong>View City Stats</strong> — Opens the city stats page (available on all devices), showing
                detailed statistics for the player’s city. Caching and error notes from the Visit button apply here as
                well.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">

            <li><strong>Right (bottom on smaller devices) part</strong> — Opponent’s team</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can:
