    <h3>Player Profile Help Guide</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The Player Profile page provides a detailed overview of an individual player's progress, performance, and
        history. It combines general stats, interactive elements, historical data, and visual insights to help you
        analyze any player across multiple dimensions.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>General Information</h5>
        <p>
            The top section of the profile shows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Player avatar and name</li>
            <li>Current alliance (if any) — clickable and links to the
                <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_ALLIANCE_PROFILE_PATH">Alliance Profile page</a></li>
            <li>World</li>
            <li>Current ranking position and ranking points</li>
            <li>Player’s age</li>

    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Action Buttons</h5>
        <p>
            Below the general information, there are two main action buttons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>City Snapshot Date Picker</strong> — Use it to choose a date for which a city
                layout snapshot is available. Keep in mind that we don’t fetch layouts for all cities every day. If
                you’d like to maintain a history of the city layouts, visit the Player Profile page and click the
                Visit button — this will preserve the city’s layout for that day.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visit</strong> — Opens the player's Capital city in the <a
                    href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_CITY_PLANNER_PATH">City Planner</a>. This
                feature is only available on larger screens. Note that city layouts are cached and might be slightly
                outdated. If the button re-enables but does not redirect, an error likely occurred or the city could not
                be fetched.
            </li>
            <li><strong>View City Stats</strong> — Opens the city stats page (available on all devices), showing
                detailed statistics for the player’s city. Caching and error notes from the Visit button apply here as
                well.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Arena Battles</strong> — Appears when either the player or their battle opponent has
                submitted their Arena battles using the<a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_BROWSER_EXTENSION_PATH">
                    browser extension</a>. Click it to explore all recorded Arena battles for that player.
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
                    Each battle is shown with two panels:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Left (top on smaller devices) part — Player’s team</li>
                    <li>Right (bottom on smaller devices) part — Opponent’s team</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
                    You can:

                    href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.BASE_TREASURE_HUNT_PATH">Treasure Hunt</a> event. Includes the
                maximum achievable points for the displayed
