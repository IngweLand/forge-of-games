        <h5>Importing Your Equipment</h5>
        <p>
            Want to see your in-game gear on the Equipment page? Start by importing your data from the game.

        <h5>Staying in Sync</h5>
        <p>You always have one active set of equipment data at a time. Each new import replaces the previous one. To keep your data up-to-date, simply export your game data again through the extension and then reload the page.</p>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Using the Equipment Table</h5>
        <p>Once imported, all your equipment is displayed in a sortable table format. Each item is shown along with its full set of properties, helping you quickly find what you need.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on any column title to sort the table by that property</li>
            <li>By default, the table is sorted first by <strong>Slot</strong>, then <strong>Rarity</strong>, and finally <strong>Level</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Viewing on Mobile</h5>
        <p>The Equipment table is accessible on mobile devices. However, due to the number of data columns, the layout is best experienced on larger screens.</p>
