    <h3>Hero Playgrounds Help Guide</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        Hero Playgrounds is a powerful tool designed to explore and analyze all available heroes in the game. It lets
        you simulate different hero configurations, understand how various levels and upgrades affect performance, and
        plan your progression strategy in detail.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Hero Overview</h5>
        <p>
            Each hero has a dedicated page that displays their main stats, including Attack, Defense, Hitpoints, and
            other core attributes. These values change dynamically based on the configuration you set.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>General Hero Information</h5>
        <p>
            At the top of the profile, you’ll find the hero's avatar, their classes, and core
            combat stats:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attack</strong> – base offensive strength</li>
            <li><strong>Defense</strong> – damage mitigation capability</li>
            <li><strong>Max Hit Points</strong> – total health pool</li>
            <li><strong>Base Damage</strong> – average damage dealt per hit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The hero avatar is interactive — click on it to toggle between a static image and a short video preview, if
            available.
        </p>
        <p>
            All values in this section change dynamically based on the configuration you set.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Customizing Hero Levels</h5>
        <p>
            Use the selectors at the top of the hero page to set:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Main Hero Level</li>
            <li>Ability Level</li>
            <li>Awakening Level</li>
            <li>Barracks Level</li>
        </ul>
        <p> As you adjust any of these values, the hero's properties are updated in real time, allowing you to
            experiment with different setups. The level selectors are saved automatically. When you return to this
            hero's profile, your most recently selected levels will be restored, so you can continue where you left off.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Hero Ability Overview</h5>
        <p>
            This section displays the currently selected ability level for the hero. You'll see detailed information
            about what the ability does at that level.
        </p>
        <p>
            A progress bar below shows how quickly the ability charges — highlighting both the initial charge time and
            the recurring recharge interval.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Progression Calculator</h5>
        <p>
            Plan your upgrades more efficiently using the built-in progression calculator. Simply set a target level,
            and the calculator will show you all required resources to reach that level from the currently selected hero
            level.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Ability Cost Calculator</h5>
        <p>
            Use the ability cost calculator to determine how many mastery points you’ll need to reach a chosen target
            ability level. Simply pick your desired level, and the calculator will compute the cost from your current
            selected level.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Battles and Performance</h5>
        <p>
            This section displays performance statistics from battles where the hero has been used. Each entry in the
            table is clickable — selecting an item will take you directly to the battle log for further review and
            analysis.

    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Support Unit Details</h5>
        <p>
            Every hero page includes a section for the hero’s support unit. This section outlines the unit’s stats and
            how it enhances the hero’s abilities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Wikipedia Extract</h5>
        <p>
            The final section shows a summary extracted directly from Wikipedia for the hero. Click <strong>Read
                More</strong> to visit the full article and explore additional context.
