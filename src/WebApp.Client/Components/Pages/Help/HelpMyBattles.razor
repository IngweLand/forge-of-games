    <h3>My Battles</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The <strong>My Battles</strong> page is the first tool powered by the newly introduced
        <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_SUBMISSION_ID_PATH">Submission ID</a>.
        It allows you to view all battles submitted under the same Submission ID, providing a simple and powerful
        way to track and share your battle history.
    </div>
    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>How It Works</h5>
        <p>
            At the top of the page, youâ€™ll find a text input field where you can enter a Submission ID.
            Once a valid ID is entered, additional interface elements will appear:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear Submission ID:</strong> Remove the current ID and enter a new one.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple Search:</strong> Filter battles by type using a quick search.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Advanced Search:</strong> Toggle advanced battle search by clicking the
                <em>Filter</em> icon&mdash;this works exactly like the advanced filtering in the
                <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_BATTLE_LOG_PATH">Battle Log</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Unlike the Battle Log, <strong>My Battles</strong> is not limited by a result count&mdash;you can
            see <em>all</em> battles submitted with the selected Submission ID.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Processing Speed</h5>
        <p>
            Battles submitted with a Submission ID are processed <strong>instantly</strong>. You can usually view them
            on
            the <strong>My Battles</strong> page
            within just a couple of minutes after submission.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Sharing Battles</h5>
        <p>
            You can share your battles with others simply by giving them your <strong>Submission ID</strong>.
            Anyone with that ID can open the <strong>My Battles</strong> page and view every battle you have submitted
            under it. This makes it easy to showcase your performance, track progress together with friends, or provide
            proof of activity when applying to alliances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alliance leaders can request Submission IDs from applicants to review their recent battles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be aware that once you share your Submission ID, you <strong>cannot revoke</strong> access to those battles.
            The only way to prevent future battles from being linked to the shared ID is to generate a new Submission
            ID.
            Battles already submitted will remain linked to the old ID.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a future update, we plan to introduce a <strong>Sharing ID</strong>&mdash;a temporary, shareable version
            of your Submission ID. This will allow you to give time-limited or restricted access to your battle history,
            which can be useful for short-term reviews such as alliance recruitment.
        </p>

        <h5>Important Notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Battles shown on this page are the same ones found in the Battle Log, but with an
                additional filter for Submission ID.
            </li>
            <li>
                Submission IDs are <strong>not</strong> linked to any specific player identity. Only those
                who know the ID can view the associated battles.
            </li>
