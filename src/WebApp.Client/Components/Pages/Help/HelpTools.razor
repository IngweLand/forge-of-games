    <h3>Tools Help Guide</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The game offers several powerful calculators to assist with planning your development and managing resources.
        These tools work independently and can significantly optimize your strategic decisions.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Research Calculator</h5>
        <p>
            This calculator helps estimate the total resources needed to progress from your current technology to any
            future tech goals.
            Supports both <strong>capital city</strong> and <strong>allied culture cities</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tech tree is displayed vertically and organized by age. Capital city trees feature collapsible age
            sections for easier navigation.
        </p>

        <p>The calculator workflow consists of three steps. You navigate between these steps by clicking
            <strong>Next</strong> or <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Select Opened Technologies:</strong> You can only select the latest techs you’ve unlocked. All
                prerequisites will be auto-selected and marked with a <span
                    style="background-color: var(--fog-open-tech-color); padding: 0 4px;">green</span> background.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Select Target Technologies:</strong> Again, only the final technologies can be picked, and their
                dependencies are auto-marked. Targets are shown with a <span
                    style="background-color: var(--fog-target-tech-color); padding: 0 4px;">beige</span> background.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>View Resource Requirements:</strong> A summarized resource list is generated, sorted by
                resource age.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            You can choose technologies across multiple ages—for example, calculating from the first to the last tech
            provides the cost to complete the full tech tree.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your opened technologies are saved in the browser's local storage, so they will be restored automatically
            next time.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also import currently opened technologies from the game. <a
                href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_IMPORTING_IN_GAME_DATA_PATH">Read how to do that.</a>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Building Cost Calculator</h5>
        <p>
            This tool allows you to analyze the cost of constructing or upgrading buildings within a specific city. This
            calculator is also integrated directly into the <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_CITY_PLANNER_PATH">City
                Planner</a>. To begin, select:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>City</li>
            <li>Building</li>
            <li>Current Level</li>
            <li>Target Level</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Special icons next to each level indicate their availability:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="material-symbols-outlined help-icon-inline">construction</span> – level can be constructed
                directly
            </li>
            <li><span class="material-symbols-outlined help-icon-inline">upgrade</span> – level can only be reached via
                upgrade
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The results are displayed in a table showing both required <strong>time</strong> and
            <strong>resources</strong>.
            Two cost columns are presented:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Construction Cost</strong> – from scratch to target level, considering the nearest constructible
                level and any upgrade-only steps.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade Cost</strong> – step-by-step from the current to target level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This distinction helps determine whether to upgrade or demolish and rebuild.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>World Wonder Calculator</h5>
        <p>
            Easily calculate the total number of <strong>resources</strong> needed to progress your world wonder in a
            given city.
            Simply select the city and define:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current Level</li>
            <li>Target Level</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The calculator will output the total resources required for that upgrade and the basket count which will be
            filled.
        </p>
