    <h3>Submission ID</h3>

    <div class="help-step">
        <p>
            Starting from the version 1.1.0, <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_BROWSER_EXTENSION_PATH">HoH Helper
                browser extension</a> introduces an optional feature called <strong>Submission ID</strong>.
            This is a randomly generated UUIDv4-compliant string attached to your submissions. Its main purpose is to
            allow you to view your battle history and other data on <em>Forge of Games</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Submission ID is not tied to any identity (real or in-game); it’s a completely random and anonymous
            string.
            Only the person who knows the Submission ID can access the data associated with it. If you choose to use
            this feature, we strongly recommend saving your Submission ID in a secure location. There is <strong>no way
                to recover it</strong> if it’s lost.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can generate a new Submission ID at any time, delete the current one, or even edit it. Editing is useful
            if you play on multiple devices and want to link data to the same Submission ID. Please note that there is
            only
            <strong>one Submission ID</strong> stored in the extension. If you play multiple accounts or servers in the
            same browser,
            all submissions will be associated with the same ID.
        </p>

        <p>
            This feature enables new functionality on Forge of Games, such as <a
                href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_MY_BATTLES_PATH">viewing your complete battle history</a>. More
            features may be added in the future that leverage this Submission ID for personalization.

        <h5>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h5>

        <p>Q: What happens if someone else gets my Submission ID?</p>
        <p>
            A: That person will be able to view data submitted with that ID, but without knowing it belongs to you, they
            cannot associate it with your in-game or real-world identity. The Submission ID alone reveals nothing about
            who you are.
        </p>

        <p>Q: Can I share my Submission ID?</p>
        <p>
            A: Yes, if you want others to view your submitted data. However, note that you <strong>cannot
                revoke</strong> access
            after sharing it. You can only generate a new Submission ID to stop linking future submissions to the old
            one.
            Already submitted data will remain linked to the previous ID.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the future, we plan to introduce a <strong>Sharing ID</strong>—a temporary, shareable version of your
            Submission ID,
            useful for specific cases like applying to alliances. This will offer time-limited or restricted data
            access.
        </p>

        <p>Q: Can I remove my submitted data?</p>
        <p>
            A: No. Because we do not associate Submission IDs with player identities, we have no way to verify that a
            deletion
            request is legitimate—even if you provide a Submission ID. As a result, we cannot support deletion requests.
        </p>

        <p>Q: Is Submission ID mandatory?</p>
        <p>
            A: No, it is completely optional. You can use HoH Helper without ever enabling or configuring a Submission
            ID.
            However, enabling it unlocks advanced features on Forge of Games.
