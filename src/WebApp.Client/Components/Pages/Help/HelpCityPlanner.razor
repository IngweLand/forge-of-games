    <h3>City Planner General Guide</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The City Planner is a comprehensive tool designed to help you construct and optimize the layout of your capital
        and allied culture cities. It provides detailed statistics about production, building usage, happiness
        efficiency, and more ‚Äî making it ideal for maximizing your city‚Äôs potential.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>City Planner Dashboard</h5>
        <p>
            The dashboard is the central place to manage all your saved cities.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can <strong>create a new city</strong> by clicking the <em>Create</em> button. You'll name the city,
            choose its type (Capital or Allied Culture), and if it's an allied city, select the associated Wonder.
            <strong>Note:</strong> The Wonder selection affects stats and cannot be changed later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from creating a city from scratch, there are other ways to get city layouts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Import your own cities</strong> using in-game data ‚Äî see <a
                    href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_IMPORTING_IN_GAME_DATA_PATH">Importing Game Data Help</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visit another player's city</strong> by going to their profile and clicking the <em>Visit</em>
                button ‚Äî see <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_PLAYER_PROFILE_PATH">Player Profile Help</a>. You
                can then save that city to your dashboard.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All city layouts are stored locally in your browser. The full City Planner app is only available on larger
            screens.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Viewing City Stats</h5>
        <p>
            The City Stats view is a dedicated page that shows only the detailed statistics of a city ‚Äî without
            any layout or planning functionality. It presents the same properties panel found in the
            <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_CITY_PLANNER_APP_PATH">City Planner App</a>, but is focused solely
            on metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            This view is accessible on all devices and is especially mobile-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can access the City Stats view from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <em>View City Stats</em> button after importing in-game data ‚Äî see <a
                    href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_IMPORTING_IN_GAME_DATA_PATH">Importing Game Data Help</a>.
            </li>
            <li>The <em>View City Stats</em> button on any <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_PLAYER_PROFILE_PATH">Player
                    Profile</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>City Planning Tools</h5>
        <p>
            Several built-in tools are available within the planner to support smarter decisions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Production Comparison:</strong> Save snapshots of different layouts and compare their production
                stats side by side.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Building Cost Calculator:</strong> Estimate resource costs required to construct or upgrade the
                building.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Inspirations Page</h5>
        <p>
            The Inspirations page showcases high-efficiency layouts created by other players. Access it from the City
            Planner dashboard and follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the city age.</li>
            <li>Choose your preferred resource focus: ü•ó <em>food</em>, üí∞ <em>coins</em>, or üè≠ <em>goods</em>.</li>
            <li>Optionally enable the <em>Allow premium buildings</em> toggle to include such layouts in results.</li>
            <li>You can use one of your own saved cities as an expansion template for searches. If no exact match is
                found, the system uses total area to find close results.
            </li>
            <li>Click <em>Search</em>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            <li>Happiness Usage Ratio (efficiency indicator)</li>
            <li>Player name</li>
