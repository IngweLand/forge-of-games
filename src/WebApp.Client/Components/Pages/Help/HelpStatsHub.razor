    <h3>Stats Hub: Community-Driven Analytics</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
            The Stats Hub aggregates data across <em>Heroes of History</em> to provide
            leaderboards, metrics, and trend analysis for players and alliances. This
            information is largely crowdsourced—meaning it depends on contributions
            from users like you!
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>How the Stats Hub Works</h5>
        <p>
            Whenever you or other community members load the <em>Heroes of History</em> game
            with our HoH Helper extension active, the in-game leaderboards and relevant
            stats are collected and sent to Forge of Games. Our servers then compile
            this data to power the Stats Hub’s rankings and historical insights.
        </p>
