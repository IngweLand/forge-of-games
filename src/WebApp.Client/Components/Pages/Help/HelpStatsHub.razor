    <h3>Stats Hub: Community-Driven Analytics</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The Stats Hub aggregates data across <em>Heroes of History</em> to provide
        leaderboards, metrics, and trend analysis for players, alliances, and heroes. This
        information is largely crowdsourced—meaning it depends on contributions
        from users like you!
    </div>
    
    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>How the Stats Hub Works</h5>
        <p>
            Whenever you or other community members load the <em>Heroes of History</em> game
            with our HoH Helper extension active, the in-game leaderboards and relevant
            stats are collected and sent to Forge of Games. Our servers then compile
            this data to power the Stats Hub’s rankings and historical insights.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
            The Stats Hub main page showcases several dynamic lists:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top Players from both Main and Beta worlds</li>
            <li>Top Alliances from both Main and Beta worlds</li>
            <li>Hero Insights – highlighting the most popular heroes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each list includes a <strong>View All</strong> button, allowing you to explore the full corresponding data page.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Players and Alliances</h5>
        <p>
            The <strong>Players</strong> and <strong>Alliances</strong> pages display ranked lists filtered by world (Main or Beta).
            You’ll find a search bar above each list to look up specific players or alliances by name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note: These lists may not contain every player or alliance, only those contributed by users or collected by our system.
            Learn how to contribute in the section below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clicking on any item in the list will navigate to the respective
            <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_PLAYER_PROFILE_PATH">Player Profile Help</a> or
            <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_ALLIANCE_PROFILE_PATH">Alliance Profile Help</a> page.

        <h5>Hero Insights</h5>
        <p>
            The <strong>Hero Insights</strong> section provides statistical analysis based on the top 5 most powerful heroes of the players.
        </p>
        <p>Two types of insights are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Most Popular Heroes:</strong> Displays the 10 heroes that most frequently appear in players' top 5.
                You can filter results by <em>hero age</em> and <em>level range</em>. The output reflects the most popular heroes
                among those that match your selected filters. If several heroes are tied for the last position, one is chosen at random.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Highest-Level Heroes:</strong> Highlights heroes who have reached the highest levels among all collected data.
                After applying an optional <em>age filter</em>, the system shows all heroes whose levels match the top 5 levels found in the filtered group.
                The number of results may vary depending on the data.
            </li>
        </ul>
