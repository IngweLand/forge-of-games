    <h3>Stats Hub: Community-Driven Analytics</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The Stats Hub aggregates data across <em>Heroes of History</em> to provide
        leaderboards, metrics, and trend analysis for players, alliances, and heroes. Part of this
        information is crowdsourced—meaning it depends on contributions from users like you!
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>How the Stats Hub Works</h5>
        <p>
            We collect data for the Stats Hub from multiple sources, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Our internal automated scripts, which gather available game information
            </li>
            <li>
                Whenever you or other community members load the <em>Heroes of History</em> game
                with our HoH Helper extension active, the in-game leaderboards and relevant
                stats are collected and sent to Forge of Games.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our servers then compile this data to power the Stats Hub’s rankings and historical insights.
        </p>

        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
            The Stats Hub main page showcases several dynamic lists:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top Players</li>
            <li>Top Alliances</li>
            <li>Top Players by filled boxes during all Allied Cultures events</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            Each list includes a <strong>View All</strong> button, allowing you to explore the full corresponding data
            page.
        </p>
        <p>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Players and Alliances</h5>
        <p>
            The <strong>Players</strong> and <strong>Alliances</strong> pages display ranked lists.
            You’ll find a search bar above each list to look up specific players or alliances by name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note: These lists may not contain every player or alliance. If you find a player or alliance missing,
            the best way to add them is to contribute your data.

        <h5>Hero Insights</h5>
        <p>
            The <strong>Hero Insights</strong> section provides statistical analysis based on the top 5 most powerful
            heroes of the players.
        </p>
        <p>Several insight types are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Most Popular Heroes:</strong> Displays the 10 heroes that most frequently appear in players' top
                5.
                You can filter results by <em>hero age</em> and <em>level range</em>. The output reflects the most
                popular heroes
                among those that match your selected filters. If several heroes are tied for the last position, one is
                chosen at random.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Highest-Level Heroes:</strong> Highlights heroes who have reached the highest levels among all
                collected data.
                After applying an optional <em>age filter</em>, the system shows all heroes whose levels match the top 5
                levels found in the filtered group.
                The number of results may vary depending on the data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Top Players (Top 100, Top 500, etc.):</strong> Shows the 10 most popular heroes among a selected
                group of top-ranked players.
            </li>
        </ul>
