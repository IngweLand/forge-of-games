    <h3>City Planner App Help Guide</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The City Planner is a layout management tool that allows you to design, organize, and optimize your city. You
        can place and rearrange buildings, manage city properties, and experiment with layouts using snapshots and the
        inventory system.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Main Layout Area</h5>
        <p>
            The central working area represents your city bounds. You can <strong>open or close expansions</strong> by
            clicking on them. Buildings can be placed inside open expansions or outside the city limits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each building type has a distinct color. Buildings include two labels: <strong>name</strong> and <strong>level</strong>.
            Cultural buildings do not display names and are colored violet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buildings whose production is affected by happiness have a small <strong>happiness indicator disc</strong>.
            A fully violet disc means maximum happiness boost; a quarter-filled disc means 25% of the maximum bonus.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Top Toolbar</h5>
        <p>
            The top toolbar includes key tools:

        <h5>Keyboard Shortcuts</h5>
        <p>
            City Planner supports a few useful keyboard shortcuts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><kbd>Delete</kbd> / <kbd>Backspace</kbd> — Delete the selected building</li>
            <li><kbd>R</kbd> — Rotate the selected building</li>
            <li><kbd>D</kbd> — Duplicate the selected building</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Construction Menu (Left Panel)</h5>
        <p>
            The left panel lists all available buildings for your current city, organized by type. When Inventory is
            active, this panel displays stored buildings instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            To place a building, click its item. It will be placed in the first fitting position (starting from the
            top-left), or outside the layout if no space is found.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Right Panel Overview</h5>
        <p>
            The right panel is a dynamic area that provides detailed information and tools depending
            on the menu you select. At the top of the panel, you'll find a vertical list of icon buttons — each one
            opens a different view inside the panel. Only one menu is active at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following menus are available:
        </p>

            The same calculator found in the <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_TOOLS_PATH">Tools</a>. When one building is selected, it shows its

            <strong>No auto-save!</strong> Be sure to save often to avoid losing progress. Saves are stored in your
            browser’s local storage, including layout, snapshots, and inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
            To share a layout, open the Settings menu and click <strong>Share</strong>. In the dialog, press <strong>Create
                Link</strong>, then copy the link. On opening, the recipient will be asked for a city name before saving

        <p>
            Inventory helps you temporarily remove buildings from the layout and reuse them easily:

        <ul>
            <li>Toggle Inventory: <span class="material-symbols-outlined help-icon-inline">shelves</span></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            When active, the left panel shows stored buildings. Clicking a stored item places it at its original
            location if available; otherwise, the next fitting spot or outside layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inventory data is saved with the city.
