    <h3>Importing In-Game Data into City Planner & Command Center</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
            The City Planner and Command Center tools on Forge of Games let you manage, optimize,
            and review your city layouts, hero rosters, and equipment with ease. To take full advantage of these
            features, you’ll want to import your actual in-game data—so that what you see here matches
            what’s in <em>Heroes of History</em>.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Step 1: Install the HoH Helper Extension</h5>
        <p>
            The easiest way to import your data is via the
            <strong>HoH Helper</strong> browser extension, which automatically collects your city
            and hero data whenever the game is loaded. It is available for Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers
            (like Microsoft Edge) that support extensions.
        </p>

            If you haven’t already, please visit our
            <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_BROWSER_EXTENSION_PATH">
                Extension Guide
            </a>
            to learn how to install and configure HoH Helper. The guide explains both the upcoming
            Chrome Web Store installation (once available) and how to install the extension from source
            immediately in Developer Mode.

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Step 2: Capture Your In-Game Data</h5>
        <p>
            Once you have the extension installed:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your <em>Heroes of History</em> game in Google Chrome and let it load fully.</li>
            <li>The extension will detect your city layout and heroes in the background.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Step 3: Export Data to Forge of Games</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Click the HoH Helper extension icon in your browser’s toolbar. A popup will appear,
                showing the <strong>“HoH City Planner and Command Center”</strong> section.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the <strong>Export Game Data</strong> button is active, click it. (If it’s inactive,
                reload your game page.)
            </li>
            <li>
                The extension will send the captured data (your city layout, heroes and equipment) to the Forge of Games
                servers. If successful, a new tab opens with a custom link.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <em>Tip:</em> Make sure you have the most current in-game data by reloading your game
            before exporting. This ensures any recent upgrades or layout changes are captured.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Step 4: Import into City Planner or Command Center</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The newly opened page on Forge of Games will let you choose which data
                (city layout, heroes, equipment) you’d like to import.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click <strong>Import</strong>. Once successful, head over to the City Planner
                or Command Center to review and manage your newly imported data.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            That’s it—you’re ready to start optimizing your city layouts or strategizing your heroes!

        <h5>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h5>

        <h6>Q: Why is my data out of date?</h6>
        <p>
            A: The extension captures your data only when the game first loads. If you’ve
            made changes since then, just reload the game and export again.
        </p>

        <h6>Q: I have multiple tabs or servers open. Which data is used?</h6>
        <p>
            A: Whichever game tab was loaded most recently will have its data captured.
            If you want data from another server or tab, reload that tab before exporting.
        </p>

        <h6>Q: Do I need to keep the game open while importing data?</h6>
        <p>
            A: No. Once the game’s data is captured and the extension sends it to our server,
            you can import at any time—though note that if you continue playing and make changes,
            those changes won’t be included unless you export again.
