    <h3>Hero Playgrounds Help Guide</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        Hero Playgrounds is a powerful tool designed to explore and analyze all available heroes in the game. It lets
        you simulate different hero configurations, understand how various levels and upgrades affect performance, and
        plan your progression strategy in detail.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Hero Overview</h5>
        <p>
            Each hero has a dedicated page that displays their main stats, including Attack, Defense, Hitpoints, and
            other core attributes. These values change dynamically based on the configuration you set.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Customizing Hero Levels</h5>
        <p>
            Use the selectors at the top of the hero page to set:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Main Hero Level</li>
            <li>Ability Level</li>
            <li>Awakening Level</li>
            <li>Barracks Level</li>
        </ul>
        <p> As you adjust any of these values, the hero's properties are updated in real time, allowing you to
            experiment with different setups.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Progression Calculator</h5>
        <p>
            Plan your upgrades more efficiently using the built-in progression calculator. Simply set a target level,
            and the calculator will show you all required resources to reach that level from the currently selected hero
            level.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Battles and Performance</h5>
        <p>
            This section displays performance statistics from battles where the hero has been used. Each entry in the
            table is clickable — selecting an item will take you directly to the battle log for further review and
            analysis.

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Support Unit Details</h5>
        <p>
            Every hero page includes a section for the hero’s support unit. This section outlines the unit’s stats and
            how it enhances the hero’s abilities.
