    <h3>Battle Log: Learn from Real Fights</h3>

    <div class="help-info">
        The Battle Log is a part of the <a href="@FogUrlBuilder.PageRoutes.HELP_STATS_HUB_PATH">Stats Hub</a>, focused
        on detailed records of real battles in <em>Heroes of History</em>. Players submit these battle reports to help
        others understand which team compositions work—and which don't.
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>What Battle Log Shows</h5>
        <p>
            The page displays a list of real battles submitted by the community. For each battle, you can see the
            participating heroes, their properties (like level and type), and the outcome. This helps you plan your own
            teams more effectively.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Using the Filters</h5>
        <p>
            At the top of the Battle Log, use the form to search for specific encounters by selecting battle type,
            difficulty, region, and other options.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also filter by hero units: click a shadowed portrait to select a hero, or click a selected one to
            remove it. The search will return battles where <strong>all</strong> selected heroes were present.
        </p>
        <p>
            After applying filters, you’ll see the most recent matching battles with hero details included.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-step">
        <h5>Accessing the Battle Log</h5>
        <p>
            You can open the Battle Log from the main menu or via dedicated buttons at the top right of Campaign region
            and Treasure Hunt stage pages.
            When opened this way, the form will be pre-filled with the corresponding region or stage to help you search
            faster.
        </p>

        <h5>Why It Matters</h5>
        <p>
            Seeing what worked—or failed—for other players is one of the best ways to improve. With more shared battles,
            the suggestions and insights become stronger for the whole community.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Your data helps others, just like theirs helps you.</strong></p>
